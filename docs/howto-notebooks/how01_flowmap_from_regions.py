# # How to Build a FlowMap from Regions
#
# A printed score is **folded**: every coordinate on it is written once, even
# where the music is played several times or skipped entirely. A performance is
# **unfolded**: it plays a particular *path* through the page, in which some
# spans are repeated, some are omitted, and the rest follow in a single stream.
#
# A {{< glossary FlowMap >}} is the bidirectional map between those two views. It
# is an ordered sequence of {{< glossary TimeInterval >}}s cut from the folded
# timeline; concatenating them in order gives the performance (unfolded) order.
#
# This guide builds a FlowMap **from named spans you define yourself** rather
# than from parsed {{< glossary Break >}}/{{< glossary Jump >}} events. That is
# the right tool when the path is a performing decision — a cut, an omitted
# repeat, a bespoke concert ending — rather than something notated in the score.
#
# The worked example is a **cut**: a performance that plays measures 1–41,
# **skips measures 42 and 43**, then continues from measure 44 to the end.
#
# **Learning objectives:**
#
# 1. Mark the played spans as {{< glossary Region >}}s on the folded timeline
# 2. Build and attach a FlowMap in one call with `Timeline.create_flow_map()`
# 3. Map a folded coordinate to its performance position with
#    `unfold_coordinate()` — and see a skipped coordinate return `[]`
# 4. `fold()` a performance coordinate back onto the score
# 5. Assemble the whole unfolded timeline with `apply_flow()` — a timeline of the
#    source's own type whose played spans are appended as named children, each
#    also recorded as a {{< glossary Region >}}
# 6. Recognise that FlowMap construction takes **one** argument in many shapes:
#    region names, `Region` objects, coordinate pairs, a `Timeline`, or a
#    collection of any of these
# 7. **Place** the spans instead of concatenating them — with `Gap` entries,
#    with `at` coordinates, or with a `{coordinate: span}` mapping — so the
#    assembled timeline can hold holes
# 8. Invert a cut: `apply_flow("source")` puts the music back where it came
#    from, restoring a timeline laid out like the score
#
# **Prerequisites:** `how01_manual_timeline_construction`, `how01_coordinate_math`

# ## Setup
#
# We work in quarterbeats (QB). The example score is 50 measures of 3/4, so each
# measure is 3 QB long and the whole score is 150 QB. `build_score()` returns a
# folded {{< glossary Timeline >}} with one downbeat marker per measure;
# `probe()` unfolds a handful of coordinates through a map so we can compare
# construction shapes side by side.

# ## The played spans
#
# The performance omits measures 42 and 43. In QB space those two measures
# occupy `[123, 129)` — the downbeat of measure 42 is at QB 123 and the downbeat
# of measure 44 is at QB 129. Everything before and after is played, so the path
# is exactly two spans:
#
# - measures 1–41 → `[0, 123)`
# - measures 44–50 → `[129, 150)`
#
# We record each span as a named {{< glossary Region >}} on the folded timeline.

# %%
CUT = (42, 43)

score.create_region("before_cut", start=0, end=before_end)
score.create_region("after_cut", start=after_start, end=score.length)

score.list_regions()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Build and attach the FlowMap
#
# `Timeline.create_flow_map()` takes the played spans as a single argument,
# resolves each region name against the timeline's own {{< glossary Region >}}s,
# builds the {{< glossary FlowMap >}}, attaches it under the given id, and
# returns it. The spans concatenate in the order given, so the unfolded timeline
# runs measures 1–41 straight into measures 44–50 with no gap.

# %%
cut_map = score.create_flow_map(["before_cut", "after_cut"], id="cut")
cut_map

# %% [markdown]
# ## Unfold a coordinate: folded → performance
#
# `unfold_coordinate()` reports where a folded coordinate lands in the
# performance. Because a folded coordinate could be played more than once (under
# a repeat), it always returns a **list** of positions. Here nothing repeats, so
# a played coordinate yields exactly one position.
#
# The first span is unshifted — measures 1–41 play at their score coordinates:

# %%
{
    "folded_qb": downbeat(11),
    "unfolded": [float(t) for t in cut_map.unfold_coordinate(downbeat(11))],
}

# %% [markdown]
# The second span slides earlier by the 6 QB of removed music (two 3-QB
# measures). Measure 46's downbeat sits at QB 135 on the page but arrives at
# QB 129 in performance:

# %%
{
    "folded_qb": downbeat(46),
    "unfolded": [float(t) for t in cut_map.unfold_coordinate(downbeat(46))],
}

# %% [markdown]
# ### A skipped coordinate returns `[]`
#
# The downbeats of the omitted measures 42 and 43 lie in neither span, so they
# are played **nowhere**. `unfold_coordinate()` returns an empty list — the
# coordinate has no performance position at all.

# %%
probe(cut_map, [downbeat(42), downbeat(43)])

# %% [markdown]
# ## Fold: performance → folded
#
# `fold()` is the inverse. The performance timeline has no repeated positions,
# so it always returns a single folded coordinate. Folding measure 46's arrival
# time (QB 129 in performance) recovers its score position (QB 135):

# %%
{"performance_qb": 129.0, "folded": float(cut_map.fold(129.0))}

# %% [markdown]
# The map is also attached to the timeline under its id, so
# `score.unfold_coordinate()` and `score.fold()` delegate to it without your
# having to hold the FlowMap object:

# %%
{
    "via_timeline_unfold": score.unfold_coordinate(downbeat(46), id="cut"),
    "via_timeline_fold": score.fold(129.0, id="cut"),
}

# %% [markdown]
# ## Unfold the whole timeline
#
# Everything above maps a *single* coordinate. To materialise the entire
# performance as its own timeline, call `apply_flow()` with the attached
# FlowMap's id. Where `unfold_coordinate()` answers "where does this one
# coordinate land?", `apply_flow(id)` assembles the whole performance: it returns
# a new timeline of the **source's own concrete type** — here a
# `ContinuousLogicalTimeline`, not some special container — and appends each played
# span as a **child**, named for the {{< glossary Region >}} it was cut from.
#
# Its length is the two spans summed (123 QB before the cut + 21 QB after =
# 144 QB), the 6 QB of the omitted measures removed from the folded 150.

# %%
unfolded = score.apply_flow("cut")
{
    "type": type(unfolded).__name__,

    "length_qb": float(unfolded.length.value),

# %% [markdown]
# Each played span is now a **child** whose id and name are the source Region's
# name, in the order they are played. `list_children()` names them and
# `get_child()` returns one:

# %%
{
    "children": unfolded.list_children(),
    "before_cut": unfolded.get_child("before_cut"),
}

# %% [markdown]
# `apply_flow()` also records each span as a {{< glossary Region >}} on the
# result — in **performance** (unfolded) coordinates, not the folded ones. These
# named Regions are what let the unfolding be inverted later: they carry the
# information needed to fold a performance coordinate back onto the score.

# %%

# The flattened event stream — every child's events in performance order —
# is available with `get_events(include_children=True)`:

# %%
unfolded.get_events(include_children=True).to_dataframe()

# %% [markdown]
# ## One argument, many shapes
#
# FlowMap construction is uniform: the same single argument accepts anything
# that describes an interval, on its own or as a collection. The region-name
# list above is one shape. `FlowMap(...)` builds the map directly (without
# attaching it to a timeline) from the others.
#
# **Coordinate pairs** — each `(start, end)` is a folded span:

# %%
cut_from_pairs = FlowMap([(0, before_end), (after_start, 150)], id="cut_pairs")
probe(cut_from_pairs, [downbeat(11), downbeat(42), downbeat(46)])

# %% [markdown]
# **`Region` objects** — reuse the regions already on the timeline:

# %%
cut_from_regions = FlowMap(
    [score.get_region("before_cut"), score.get_region("after_cut")],
    id="cut_regions",
)
probe(cut_from_regions, [downbeat(11), downbeat(42), downbeat(46)])

# %% [markdown]
# All three constructions describe the same path, so they unfold identically:

# %%
probes = [downbeat(11), downbeat(42), downbeat(46)]
{
    "from_region_names": probe(cut_map, probes),
    "from_pairs": probe(cut_from_pairs, probes),
    "from_regions": probe(cut_from_regions, probes),
}

# %% [markdown]
# A **single** interval-like value is equally valid and needs no wrapping list —
# `FlowMap((0, 123))` is a one-span map, and passing a whole
# {{< glossary Timeline >}} takes its full extent as one span. Whatever the
# shape, the result is one FlowMap with the same `unfold_coordinate()`/`fold()`
# behaviour.

# %%
one_span = FlowMap((0, before_end), id="opening_only")
probe(one_span, [downbeat(11), downbeat(46)])

# %% [markdown]
# ## Placing spans instead of concatenating them
#
# Everything so far **concatenates**: each span starts where the previous one
# ended, which is how a performance runs. Undoing a performance needs the
# opposite. To put the cut music back on the page, the second span has to
# return to measure 44 and the six removed quarters have to reopen as a hole.
#
# Three constructions state that placement. They build the identical map, so
# pick whichever reads best for what you know:
#
# | You know | Write |
# |----------|-------|
# | *what is missing* — two measures, 6 QB | `[a, Gap(6), b]` |
# | *where things go* — QB 0 and QB 129 | `at=[0, 129]` |
# | *both, paired* — e.g. from a table | `{0: a, 129: b}` |
#
# Take the performance as the source this time: a 144 QB timeline whose two
# spans meet at QB 123. Restoring it means placing the second span at QB 129.

# The map now reports a **gap**: a stretch of the target axis that no source
# material fills. `iter_gaps()` lists them, whether you wrote them as `Gap`
# entries or left them implied by the coordinates:

[(float(start), float(end)) for start, end, _label in restored_gaps.iter_gaps()]

# ### `Gap()` sizes itself
#
# Written against the **folded** score, whose spans already sit six quarters
# apart, a bare `Gap()` measures the hole its neighbours leave and needs no
# arithmetic from you:

# %%

    ),
}

# %% [markdown]
# ## Inverting a cut
#
# You rarely have to write any of that by hand. `apply_flow()` attaches a
# reverse map under the id `"source"`, and inverting a FlowMap simply swaps its
# two axes — so the inverse already carries each span's original coordinates.
# Applying it rebuilds a timeline laid out like the score it came from.
#
# Unfold the cut, then unfold the result back along `"source"`:

# %%
unfolded = score.apply_flow("cut")
restored = unfolded.apply_flow("source")

{
    "performance_qb": float(unfolded.length.value),
    "restored_qb": float(restored.length.value),
    "after_cut_at": float(restored.get_child_offset("after_cut").value),
    "measure": int(restored.get_child_offset("after_cut").value) // QB_PER_MEASURE + 1,
}

# %% [markdown]
# Measures 1–41 sit at QB 0 and measures 44–50 are back at QB 129 — the
# downbeat of measure 44 — with the two omitted measures empty between them.
# The full 150 QB extent returns as well: the FlowMap records the length of the
# axis it was built on, so nothing is lost off the end.
#
# The omitted music itself does **not** come back. The cut discarded it, and no
# inverse can recover what a flow dropped — the restoration is of the *layout*,
# not of the material:

# %%
restored_downbeats = {e["id"] for e in restored.get_events(include_children=True)}
{
    "children": restored.list_children(),
    "n_downbeats": len(restored_downbeats),  # 48 of the score's 50
    "m42_and_m43_gone": {"m42", "m43"}.isdisjoint(restored_downbeats),
}

# %% [markdown]
# ### Filling the holes
#
# By default a hole is plain empty space. Pass `fill_gaps=True` to close it
# with an **empty child** instead, so the result tiles its axis contiguously.
# That is required when the timeline is a {{< glossary SegmentLine >}}, which
# admits no space between its segments:

# %%
filled = unfolded.apply_flow("source", fill_gaps=True)
{
    "children": filled.list_children(),
    "offsets": [
        float(filled.get_child_offset(name).value) for name in filled.list_children()
    ],
    "gap_length_qb": float(filled.get_child("gap_1").length.value),
}

# |------|-----|
# | Mark a played span | `timeline.create_region(name, start, end)` |
# | Build + attach a FlowMap from spans | `timeline.create_flow_map(intervals, id=...)` |
# | Build a FlowMap directly | `FlowMap(intervals, id=...)` |
# | Accepted `intervals` shapes | region name, `Region`, `(start, end)`, `Timeline`, or interval event |
# | Coordinate folded → performance (1→N) | `flow_map.unfold_coordinate(coord)` · `timeline.unfold_coordinate(coord)` |
# | A skipped coordinate | `unfold_coordinate()` returns `[]` |
# | Map a coordinate performance → folded (N → 1) | `flow_map.fold(coord)` · `timeline.fold(coord, id=...)` |
# | Assemble the whole unfolded timeline | `timeline.apply_flow(id)` → one child + Region per span |
# | Inspect / flatten the result | `.list_children()` · `.get_events(include_children=True)` |
# | Leave a hole of a known size | `Gap(6)` in the span list · `Gap()` to auto-size it |
# | Place spans at known coordinates | `at=[0, 129]` · `{0: span, 129: span}` · `FlowMap.from_dict(...)` |
# | List the holes in a map | `flow_map.iter_gaps()` · `flow_map.n_gaps` |
# | Fold a coordinate inside a hole | `fold()` raises — it belongs to no span |
# | Restore the source layout from a performance | `unfolded.apply_flow("source")` |
# | Close the holes with empty children | `apply_flow(id, fill_gaps=True)` |
#
# The same {{< glossary FlowMap >}} also unfolds *repeats* — a span listed twice
# plays twice, and `unfold_coordinate()` then returns two positions. In the
# assembled timeline that span appears as two children: the first occurrence
# bare (`before_cut`) and the second suffixed `before_cut-rend2`, following the
# Verovio rendering-order convention (`-rend3`, `-rend4`, … for any further
# repeats). Unnamed coordinate-pair spans fall back to `span_1`, `span_2`, … .
# For repeats read straight from a score's notated {{< glossary Break >}}s and
# {{< glossary Jump >}}s, see the multimodal alignment guide.
