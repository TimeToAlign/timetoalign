# # Pitch and Harmony across Formats
#
# ## What you will build
#
# You will build a typed comparison of pitch information from an ms3 table,
# two MusicXML readers, a MIDI performance, and a note-alignment export. By
# the end, you can state exactly which sources preserve a written spelling and
# which preserve only a sounding pitch, then apply the same distinction to
# harmony labels.
#
# ## Before you start
#
# Complete [The Data Model](tut08_data_model.ipynb) first; this notebook reuses
# its scalar, field, and protocol pattern.
