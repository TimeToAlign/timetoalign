# ## What you will build
#
# You will build a folded {{< glossary Timeline >}}, describe its played order,
# and obtain an unfolded timeline that preserves the route back to the page.
# You will also build a {{< glossary BeatGrid >}} whose measures and beats can
# be queried in either direction, survive a tempo change, and be exported for
# annotation software.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Before you start
#
# Complete [Nesting and Timestamps](tut02_nesting_and_timestamps.ipynb),
# [Loading Real Data](tut04_loading_data.ipynb), and
# [Timeline Groups](tut05_timeline_groups.ipynb) first. This notebook follows
# [Alignment Bundles](tut06_alignment_bundles.ipynb) in reading order but does
# not depend on its bundles or claims.

# We reuse `create_region` from the nesting tutorial.

# played route refer to legible musical spans rather than unexplained numbers.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Building the map
#
# A {{< glossary FlowMap >}} records how folded spans are placed in played
# order. `create_flow_map(intervals)` accepts a name, a Region, a `(start, end)`
# pair, a Timeline, or an iterable mixing any of those shapes.

# The single `flow_intervals` argument mixes a region name with Region objects.
# `add_flow_map` attaches an existing map under another id; `get_flow_map` and
# `list_flow_maps` retrieve and enumerate the attached maps.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Unfolding one position
#
# `unfold_coordinate(coord)` takes one folded position and returns a list,
# because repeated material can occur at several positions in performance.

# %% [markdown]
# The position in A appears once in each rendition. The empty list for B is the
# correct answer, not a failure: that written span is absent from this route.
# This timeline convenience method returns plain numbers, so its played
# positions do not carry the written timeline's quarter unit.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Folding back
#
# `fold(coord)` goes in the other direction: many possible performance
# positions collapse to one position on the written page.

# %%

# The second rendition folds back to the original written value. Like
# `unfold_coordinate`, this convenience method returns a plain number rather
# than a unit-bearing Coordinate. Keep the directions distinct: unfolding is
# one-to-many; folding is many-to-one.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Assembling the whole unfolded timeline
#
# `apply_flow(id)` constructs the complete played timeline. It preserves the
# source's concrete type and makes one {{< glossary Child >}} timeline for every
# played span.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# The second visit to A is named `A-rend2`; further visits would use `-rend3`
# and so on. Matching regions cover the spans in unfolded coordinates; those
# named intervals are what make the route invertible through the `source` map.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Inspecting repeat events
#
# Score loaders retain repeat signs and non-sequential destinations as
# flow-control {{< glossary Event >}}s. Inspecting those parsed records first
# makes the controller's later route easier to understand.

# The default route visits 505 measures from a 397-measure folded score.
# `flow_diagnostics()` would return records for traversal or repeat-resolution
# problems; the displayed `none` means it found no such problem in this score.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Segmenting the folded score
#
# Controller boundaries mark changes in the score's flow structure. A
# {{< glossary SegmentLine >}} created from them turns the folded timeline into
# adjacent, inspectable sections.

# %% [markdown]
# The first boundary coordinates retain their quarter unit. Fourteen
# boundaries divide the score into thirteen adjacent segments, and the
# SegmentLine keeps those segments as children of one timeline.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Beats as a queryable grid
#
# A {{< glossary BeatGrid >}} answers where beats and measures fall in a
# recording. It is not a timeline: it stores one tempo statement — the anchor
# instant, the tempo, the meter, and which beat of a bar the anchor is — and
# generates every beat from it. `extent` bounds the grid, normally with the
# length of the audio.

# %%

}
grid_overview

# %% [markdown]
# At 120 BPM a beat lasts half a second, so a 3/4 bar lasts one and a half and
# twelve seconds hold eight measures. Nothing was stored per beat to say so.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Both directions
#
# `seconds_at(measure, beat)` turns a label into a
# {{< glossary Coordinate >}} in seconds; `position_at(seconds)` turns a
# position into the beat sounding there.

# %%

    "its measure": sounding_beat.measure,
    "it opens a measure": sounding_beat.is_downbeat,
    "quarters in the whole grid": grid.quarters_between(0, 12),
}
direction_report

# %% [markdown]
# `position_at` names the last beat at or before the position, so a query
# between two beats answers with the earlier one — 6.25 seconds sounds within
# the downbeat of measure 5. `quarters_between` measures notated length rather
# than clock time.
#
# A beat carries its position twice, for two jobs. `seconds` is the exact ratio
# the grid computed with, which is what the beat's display leads with; `instant`
# is that position as a seconds {{< glossary Coordinate >}} — the same value
# `seconds_at` returns for the beat's own label, so the two directions meet.

# %% [markdown]
# ## The beat table and its exports
#
# `get_beat_table()` renders every beat the grid states. It is the only table
# the grid builds, and the annotation-file exports are renderings of it.
# Downbeats are the rows whose `beat` is 1.

# ## When the tempo changes
#
# One segment states one tempo. A recording that changes tempo is several
# `BeatGridSegment`s in one grid: you state each segment without an end, and
# the grid orders them and bounds each by the next one's start. A
# `BeatPolicy` says how the lattice beats group into bars.

# %% [markdown]
# The grid gave the first segment the second one's start as its end. Beats last
# half a second before six seconds and a third of a second after, so the two
# seconds around the change hold five quarters — a count no single tempo
# produces, because `quarters_between` integrates each segment's own tempo
# instead of averaging them.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Two numberings of one lattice
#
# `numbering="set"` counts measures across the whole grid; `numbering="segment"`
# restarts the count at each segment. They label the same beats, so you can read
# them side by side.

# %%

]
numbering_report

# %% [markdown]
# The faster segment opens measure 5 of the recording and measure 1 of its own
# count. Use whichever the receiving tool expects: a whole-recording annotation
# wants the running count, a per-section analysis the restarted one.

# - You can compute a score route and obtain non-raising flow diagnostics.
# - You can create a segment line from flow-section boundaries.
# - You can build a beat grid from one tempo statement and bound it with an extent.
# - You can turn a measure and beat into an instant, and an instant back into a beat.
# - You can render every beat as a table and export a real annotation CSV.
# - You can combine several tempo segments into one grid that changes tempo.
# - You can read a grid's measures counted across the whole grid or per segment.
