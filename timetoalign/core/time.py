"""Time scalars (``TimeScalar`` / ``Coordinate`` / ``Duration``) and paired fields.

This module is the single home for the four scalar pydantic models that
represent positions and elapsed extents on a timeline, together with
their paired ``SemanticField`` field wrappers.

Class hierarchy (diamond MRO for the Id-variants)::

    TimeScalar(BaseModel)                          # abstract base
    ├── Coordinate(TimeScalar)
    ├── Duration(TimeScalar)
    └── IdTimeScalar(TimeScalar)                   # adds `timeline_id`

    IdCoordinate(Coordinate, IdTimeScalar)         # diamond
    IdDuration(Duration, IdTimeScalar)             # diamond

* ``Coordinate`` denotes a position on a timeline (origin is meaningful).
* ``Duration`` denotes an elapsed extent (signed; may be negative when
  produced by ``Coordinate - Coordinate`` with the right operand later
  than the left).
* ``IdCoordinate`` / ``IdDuration`` carry the additional ``timeline_id``
  identifying the timeline they refer to.

Arithmetic semantics (all operators raise ``TypeError`` on incompatible
types and on cross-timeline-id mixing):

* ``Coordinate + Coordinate`` → ``TypeError`` (subtract to get a Duration)
* ``Coordinate + Duration``   → ``Coordinate``
* ``Coordinate - Coordinate`` → ``Duration`` (the canonical way to get one)
* ``Coordinate - Duration``   → ``Coordinate``
* ``Duration  ± Duration``    → ``Duration``
* ``Duration  ± Coordinate``  → ``TypeError``
* ``{Coord,Dur} * / // <number>`` → same kind back
* ``{Coord,Dur} * / // {Coord,Dur}`` → ``TypeError``

PyArrow storage shape (identical for Coordinate, Duration, IdCoordinate,
IdDuration): the scalar's ``value`` is denormalised into a struct
``{value: float64, numerator: int64, denominator: int64}`` so that
rational precision survives Parquet round-trips.  ``unit`` and
``timeline_id`` live in ``pa.Field.metadata`` (the ``TIMETOALIGN_METADATA_KEY``
JSON blob), NOT in the struct.

Paired-field hierarchy::

    SemanticField (Generic[T])
    └── TimeScalarField  (abstract; _raw_cls = DenominateNumberField;
                          consolidates the from_field / from_table /
                          metadata-resolve / repr plumbing)
        ├── CoordinateField   (scalar_cls = Coordinate)
        │   └── IdCoordinateField (scalar_cls = IdCoordinate, carries timeline_id)
        └── DurationField     (scalar_cls = Duration)
            └── IdDurationField   (scalar_cls = IdDuration, carries timeline_id)

The inner raw field is a ``DenominateNumberField`` (a ``RedundantNumberField``
with a single bound ``unit``) carrying the denormalised
``{value, numerator, denominator}`` struct.  ``unit`` lives in the
field's ``TIMETOALIGN_METADATA_KEY`` metadata blob; ``timeline_id`` lives there
too for the Id-variants.
