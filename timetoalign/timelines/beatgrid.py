"""Beat grids: tempo segments that generate a labelled lattice of beats.

A :class:`BeatGridSegment` states the facts an analysis program records
about one stretch of a recording — where its anchor beat sits, how fast
it runs, how its beats group into bars, and which beat of a bar the
anchor is.  Those facts generate beats forever; a :class:`BeatGrid`
assembles the segments in time order, bounds each one by its successor,
and labels the resulting beats with measure and beat numbers.

The grid is the arithmetic engine behind measure structures read from
DJ-software exports: it answers "which second is bar 449?" and "which
bar and beat is second 4329.7?", and it integrates exact quarter-note
lengths across tempo changes.
