"""Flow API: Compute unfolded measure sequences from flow control data.

This module provides classes for computing and representing "flows" — the
sequence of measure visitations that results from following flow control
instructions (repeats, voltas, D.S., D.C., etc.).

From the design spec (measure_handling_design.md Part 14):

    FlowMode: Enum for flow computation modes
    FlowStep: A single step in a Flow sequence
    Flow: A computed flow (sequence of measure visitations)
    FlowMap: Attached to timelines for coordinate transformation
    ScoreFlowController: Compute Flow paths from MeasureData

Terminology:
    - "Flow" is used uniformly instead of "traversal"
    - mc_playthrough: Monotonically increasing index in unfolded sequence
    - mn_playthrough: MN with occurrence suffix (e.g., "19a", "19b")

Gold Standard Conventions (from ms3):
    - mn_playthrough suffix: Always 'a' for first occurrence, 'b' for second
    - Split bars: Same mn_playthrough for all MCs sharing same MN
    - quarterbeats: Cumulative in unfolded, NOT reset at jumps
    - mc_playthrough: Monotonically increasing 1, 2, 3, ...
    - Final row: next = -1 indicates end of flow

    A flow controller is a factory for producing Flows and FlowMaps. It operates
    as a background processor that computes flow control transformations but
    is NOT stored on the Timeline itself. Instead, the FlowMaps it produces
    are attached to Timelines.

    Subclasses implement the specific logic for different data sources:
    - ScoreFlowController: Works with MeasureData (mc, mn, next[], volta, etc.)
    - Future: AudioFlowController, VideoFlowController for other media types.

    Design Decisions:
    - A flow controller is a factory, NOT stored on Timeline
    - Sparse sections ARE allowed (atomic sections need not cover entire timeline)
    - Unit independence: Flows are sequences of TimeIntervals in ANY unit

    ScoreFlowController computes Flow paths from MeasureData, which contains

    The algorithm operates at the section level:
    1. Derives atomic sections from next[] arrays OR accepts from partitura
    2. Uses flow control markers + volta attributes to execute flow logic
    3. Groups atomic sections into playthrough sections per FlowMode

    The algorithm follows the 'next' field in measure data, using visit
    counts to choose which branch to take at repeat points. This matches
    the ms3 unfolding algorithm.

    Attributes:
        measures: The source MeasureData.

        describing every violation it finds, and an empty list when the flow is
        well-formed.

        Currently checks the **volta-follows-volta** invariant: in the atomic
        flow graph a volta section can never have a ``to`` edge to another volta
        section. A prima volta's only out-edge is the repeat back-edge (to the
        repeat-start, a non-volta section); a seconda volta is reached only from
        the repeat-start and continues into the music that follows the bracket.
        Two flow-adjacent voltas therefore indicate a malformed ``next`` array —
        most often a jump target that resolved to the wrong ending. This is the
        ``to`` (flow) edge relation, NOT score-order adjacency: volta sections
        are naturally adjacent in MC order, which is correct; they must not be
        connected by a ``to`` edge.

        Simulates a state machine over the MCs in score order, driven
        entirely by each MeasureUnit's flow-control annotations and the
        raw marker names recorded in the measure lookup:

        - ``start_repeat`` / ``end_repeat`` delimit a repeat block. The
          natural pass count is 2 (the standard sheet-music convention);
          higher voltas (volta 3, 4, ...) are *alternative* endings
          reached only by al-Fine / al-Coda passes.
        - ``volta`` marks an ending. On pass *k* through the block, the
          ``target_volta`` is *k* — MCs marked with a different volta are
          skipped. When al-Fine is armed and the block contains a volta
          whose number exceeds the natural limit and that holds the
          ``fine`` marker, the algorithm jumps directly to that volta
          instead of cycling through earlier ones.
        - ``jump_from`` with ``jump_bwd=segno`` resets the segno's
          enclosing-block pass count so the post-jump pass plays fresh;
          ``jump_bwd=start`` does not reset anything (the natural pass's
          counters persist and naturally suppress already-exhausted
          repeats).
        - ``play_until=X`` arms a generic "play until trigger" mode. The
          trigger fires when an MC is visited whose marker name (segno,
          coda, fine, or raw ms3 ``markers`` value) matches X. For
          ``play_until="coda"`` in a score that lacks an explicit
          ``coda`` marker, the trigger falls back to the next
          atomic-section boundary (per the convention that a "to coda"
          point is always a section boundary). ``jump_fwd`` resolves to
          the MC carrying that marker; an empty ``jump_fwd`` terminates
          the traversal when the trigger fires.

        This algorithm does not follow the ms3 ``next`` field as its
        traversal path. It uses a same-MC successor only to retain a
        one-bar ``startend`` repeat when a loader has flattened away both
        repeat flags.
