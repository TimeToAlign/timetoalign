@dataclass
class FlowMapSection:
    """A section mapping in a FlowMap.

    Represents one contiguous section that maps from a source coordinate range
    to a target coordinate range. Used internally by FlowMap for coordinate
    transformation.

    In the context of flow control:
    - Source coordinates: The "folded" timeline (with repeats/jumps compressed)
    - Target coordinates: The "unfolded" timeline (linear playthrough order)

    Both ranges are carried explicitly, which is what lets a FlowMap place its
    sections rather than only concatenate them. A section is one of two kinds:

    - **Played** — both ranges have the same non-zero extent. Source material
      is carried to the target axis, at ``target_start`` rather than
      necessarily at the end of the preceding section.
    - **Gap** — one range is empty. An *insertion* (empty source range) is a
      stretch of target time no material fills; an *elision* (empty target
      range) is source material the flow drops. Inverting a FlowMap swaps the
      two ranges, so an insertion inverts to an elision and back.

    Attributes:
        source_start: Start coordinate in source timeline (inclusive).
        source_end: End coordinate in source timeline (exclusive).
        target_start: Start coordinate in target timeline.
        label: Identity of the section — the source region/section name it was
            built from, or ``None`` when the section names nothing (e.g. built
            from a bare coordinate pair). Unfolding uses this to name the
            child timeline and Region it produces for the section.
        target_end: End coordinate in target timeline. Defaults to ``None``,
            which derives it from ``target_start`` plus the source extent —
            the concatenating behaviour of an ordinary played section.

class FlowMap:
    """Coordinate transformation map for flow control.

    A FlowMap enables bidirectional coordinate conversion between a source
    timeline (with flow control) and a target (linearized) timeline:

    - Source -> Target conversion (1:N, since repeats duplicate coordinates)
    - Target -> Source lookup (N:1, always unique)

    The single positional argument, *source*, is polymorphic:

    - ``None`` — an empty map (no sections). Used by internal construction
      such as :meth:`inverse`, which fills the section tables afterwards.
    - a :class:`Flow` — sections are derived from the flow's measure-count
      ranges (integer MC space); *id* defaults to the flow's mode value.
    - a single interval-like descriptor **or** an iterable of them — sections
      are built directly from the resulting ``(start, end)`` ranges with a
      cumulative target position, so the played spans concatenate in the
      target axis and any gaps between them map to nothing. *id* defaults to
      ``"default"``. Accepted descriptors are region names (resolved through
      *resolve*), ``Region`` objects, ``(start, end)`` coordinate pairs,
      ``Timeline`` objects, and interval events — see
      :func:`~timetoalign.timelines.flow.sections._coerce_intervals`.

    Concatenation is only the default. Two independent mechanisms **place**
    the played spans on the target axis instead, so the assembled timeline can
    hold holes — which is what an inverted cut needs:

    - :class:`~timetoalign.timelines.flow.sections.Gap` entries mixed into
      *source*, each pushing everything after it later by its own duration.
    - The *at* argument, giving the target coordinate of each played span
      outright.

    The two agree on the result and may not be combined in one call. See
    :meth:`_build_from_entries` for the placement rules.

    FlowMap stores sections for efficient lookup:

    - ``_sections``: List of FlowMapSection objects
    - ``_target_boundaries``: Sorted list of target section starts for
      binary search

    Attributes:
        flow: The computed Flow, or ``None`` for interval-built maps.
        id: Identifier for this FlowMap.
        source_length: Total extent of the source axis, when known. Recorded so
            that :meth:`inverse` can restore a target axis whose final stretch
            is a gap — material the flow drops off the end leaves no section to
            infer the length from.

        The inverse FlowMap swaps the source and target coordinate systems.
        This is useful for attaching to a target timeline to enable
        tracing back to the original source.

        Because each section carries both ranges outright, inverting is a plain
        swap of the two. That is what makes an inverse **placing** rather than
        concatenating: a flow that drops material leaves its spans at their
        original source coordinates, so the inverse puts them back where they
        came from and the dropped stretch reappears as a gap. Applying the
        inverse with :meth:`~timetoalign.timelines.Timeline.apply_flow`
        therefore rebuilds a timeline laid out like the original.

        Note:
            The inverse FlowMap's unfold_coordinate() returns coordinates in
            the original source space, which may yield multiple results if the
