"""Timeline classes for TimeToAlign!

This module provides the 6 timeline types (3 domains x 2 modalities):

Domains:
- Logical: Symbolic/musical time (beats, quarters, ticks)
- Physical: Acoustic/real time (seconds, samples)
- Graphical: Visual/spatial (pixels, coordinates)

Modalities:
- Continuous: Float or Fraction coordinates
- Discrete: Integer coordinates

Public API:
- Timeline: Base class
- ContinuousLogicalTimeline, DiscreteLogicalTimeline
- ContinuousPhysicalTimeline, DiscretePhysicalTimeline
- ContinuousGraphicalTimeline, DiscreteGraphicalTimeline
