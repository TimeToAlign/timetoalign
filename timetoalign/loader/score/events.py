"""Score event-type constants.

This module defines :class:`ScoreEventType`, the shared vocabulary of
``event_type`` / ``event_category`` string constants used across the
score loaders.  Note storage itself lives in
:class:`~timetoalign.loader.score.stores.notes.NoteEventData`, which
represents pitch exactly once.
