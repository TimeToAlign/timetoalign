"""ParangonadaLoader: a multimodal AlignmentBundle from parangonada exports.

A *parangonada* export is the CSV form produced by parangonar's
parangonada visualisation.  For a single musical work it bundles, for
every recorded performance, a triple of CSV files under a per-performer
subdirectory of ``match/match_transkun/``:

* ``part.csv`` — the score notes.  Header
  ``onset_beat,duration_beat,onset_quarter,duration_quarter,onset_div,
  duration_div,pitch,voice,id``.  The score is identical across every
  performance in the dataset, so it is parsed once.  ``onset_quarter``
  is an exact rational (parsed as a :class:`~fractions.Fraction`),
  ``onset_div`` an integer in the score's division grid, and ``pitch``
  a MIDI integer.  Two arithmetic invariants tie the two grids:
  ``onset_div == 32 * onset_quarter + 16`` and
  ``duration_div == 32 * duration_quarter``.
* ``ppart.csv`` — the performed notes, timed in seconds.  Header
  ``onset_sec,duration_sec,pitch,velocity,track,channel,id``.
* ``align.csv`` — the note-level correspondences.  Header
  ``idx,matchtype,partid,ppartid``.  ``matchtype`` is ``0`` for a match
  (both ids present), ``1`` for a score-only insertion
  (``ppartid == "undefined"``), and ``2`` for a performance-only
  deletion (``partid == "undefined"``).

Each performance also carries a pair of **measured beat-feature**
files under the dataset's ``features/`` directory, tab-separated and
discovered by globbing ``<key>_measure*.{beats,dyn}`` (the file stems
are non-uniform — one performer's are ``..._measure_fix`` while the
rest are ``..._measure``):

* ``<key>_measure*.beats`` — one row per measured beat.  Header
  ``measure_number  beat  onset_beat  onset_sec  BPM  interp  swap``.
* ``<key>_measure*.dyn`` — one row per measured beat.  Header
  ``measure_number  beat  onset_beat  velocity_mean  velocity_max
  interp`` (no ``onset_sec`` column).

These are *measured* per-beat features (variable tempo and dynamics
extracted from the recording), not a synthesised tempo curve; they are
added as ``Beat`` and ``Dynamics`` events to the performance's seconds
timeline (``perf:<key>:cpt1``), alongside its ``Note`` events.  The
``.dyn`` rows have no onset of their own, so each is joined to the
``.beats`` row sharing its ``(measure_number, beat)`` key (the two
files are 1:1 on that key) to recover its ``onset_sec``.

``ParangonadaLoader`` ingests the whole dataset directory in one call::

    bundle = ParangonadaLoader.from_file(dataset_dir).create_bundle()

and produces a single :class:`~timetoalign.alignment.bundle.AlignmentBundle`
expressing the work across the logical and physical domains:

* a shared ``"score"`` group with the same notes in two logical units —
  a quarter-note :class:`~timetoalign.timelines.types.ContinuousLogicalTimeline`
  (``score:clt1``) and a division-grid
  :class:`~timetoalign.timelines.types.DiscreteLogicalTimeline`
  (``score:dlt1``) carrying a divs→quarters
  :class:`~timetoalign.maps.linear.LinearMap`;
* one ``perf:<key>`` group per performance with the performed notes in
  two physical units — a seconds
  :class:`~timetoalign.timelines.types.ContinuousPhysicalTimeline`
  (``perf:<key>:cpt1``) and a samples
  :class:`~timetoalign.timelines.types.DiscretePhysicalTimeline`
  (``perf:<key>:dpt1``) carrying a
  :class:`~timetoalign.maps.convenience.SamplesToSeconds` map; and
* a cross-group :class:`~timetoalign.alignment.anchors.MatchClaim` per
  ``align.csv`` row — a synchronous claim for a match and a NOMATCH
  claim for an insertion or a deletion.

The loader reads the *existing* alignment; it never runs an aligner.
