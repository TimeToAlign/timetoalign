"""Ieee1599Loader: one IEEE 1599 document as a multimodal AlignmentBundle.

An IEEE 1599 file is a multi-layer XML encoding of a single musical work.  Its
pivot is the ``<spine>``: a flat list of ``<event>`` elements, each with an
``id``, that every other layer points back at through ``event_ref``.  The spine
is therefore an abstract, unit-less event ordering — a *virtual timing unit*
(VTU) axis — and each layer (symbolic notation, engraved page images, audio
recordings) states where in *its own* coordinate space a given spine event
occurs.  That is exactly an alignment: the spine is the hub, the layers are
projections, and ``event_ref`` is the correspondence.

``Ieee1599Loader`` reads one document in one call::

    bundle = Ieee1599Loader.from_file(path).create_bundle()

and produces a single :class:`~timetoalign.alignment.bundle.AlignmentBundle`:

``<structural>`` per          one ``external_references`` row on the
``<segment_event>``           spine timeline, naming the Petri-net place
                              that segment maps to
every ``event_ref``           one synchronous ``MatchClaim``, projection
                              timeline against the spine, all of them in
                              one columnar ``MatchClaimField``
============================  =========================================

**Spine coordinates.**  The ``timing`` and ``hpos`` attributes of a spine
``<event>`` are *relative* integer deltas against the preceding event.  The
stored coordinate is the running sum — the cumulative VTU — so that two events
notated as simultaneous share one coordinate.  ``hpos`` is accumulated the same
way and kept as a single integer event field; the deltas are not stored
alongside, being recoverable by differencing.  Source event ids
(``part_1_voice0_measure1_ev0``, ``event_cow``, …) are preserved verbatim as
spine event ``id`` values, which is what makes ``event_ref`` resolvable on the
way back out.

**Projected layers.**  Every LOS, graphic and track event carries its raw
``event_ref`` as a field *and* contributes one synchronous claim tying its own
coordinate to the referenced spine event's VTU coordinate.  LOS events sit at
the VTU coordinate of the event they reference (that reference *is* their
temporal position); graphic events are integer-pixel interval events in their
edition SegmentLine; track events are instants at ``start_time`` seconds.

**The structural layer.**  An ``<analysis>`` partitions the spine into
``<segment>`` elements, each listing the spine events it covers as
``<segment_event event_ref="…"/>``; a sibling ``<petri_nets>`` block names the
``.pnml`` files that model those segments, a ``<place place_ref="p2"
segment_ref="…"/>`` binding one place of one net to one segment.  That is a
reference *into* an external resource, not a timing statement, so it is carried
as :attr:`~timetoalign.timelines.base.Timeline.external_references` on the
spine: one row per ``(segment_event, place)`` pair, whose ``event_id`` is the
spine event, whose ``external_id`` is the ``place_ref``, whose single access
point is the net's ``file_name`` with kind ``relative_path``, and whose
``comment`` is the segment id.  A segment no place names keeps its row —
``external_id`` the segment id, no access point, ``comment`` ``"segment without
petri-net node"`` — so the segmentation survives whole even where the
Petri-net modelling is incomplete.

**Fidelity rules.**  Notated durations are kept as the verbatim ``num`` /
``den`` integer pair (``duration_num`` / ``duration_den``) rather than a
reduced :class:`~fractions.Fraction`, so that ``4/4`` does not silently become
``1``; the exact rational is ``Fraction(duration_num, duration_den)``.
``<undefined/>`` accidental placeholders are recorded as the string
``"undefined"``, never dropped and never inferred.  Media files are never
opened: ``file_name`` and ``file_format`` are recorded verbatim even when the
file is absent from disk, and even when the format label contradicts the
extension (``video_avi`` naming a ``.mp4``).  ``.pnml`` files are not opened
either — a Petri net's places are cross-referenced from the IEEE 1599 document
itself, so the whole mapping is read there and no path is ever resolved.
Page-image coordinates are measured in pixels (``measurement_unit="pixels"``
on every ``<graphic_instance>``). They are rounded to integer pixels using
round-half-even for the graphical SegmentLine and its child timelines; the
verbatim source box is retained as the float ``source_bbox`` event field when
any of its four coordinates is fractional; it is omitted when all four are
integral. Each graphical event's integer box is a raw ``bbox`` struct with
``ul`` / ``lr`` and ``x`` / ``y`` members. Every page of an edition is its own
image file with its own pixel origin, so an edition nests two levels deep: the
edition line's segments are its pages, and a page's segments are the accolades
engraved on it. A page child carries its ``<graphic_instance>`` attributes in
``meta["page"]``, and each event keeps its own ``file_name`` and
``position_in_group``; the edition's interval-to-constant map names the page
image containing any edition coordinate.

**Known limitations.**

* An ``<analysis>`` that describes timeline events rather than spine segments
  has no representation here: the structural layer is read only through the
  ``<segment>`` / ``<place>`` chain that resolves to spine events.
* ``<staff_list>`` clefs, key signatures and time signatures reference spine
  events but are not note/rest/lyric content; they are kept in the curated
  ``staff_list`` store table and do not become timeline events or claims.
* The ``performance`` layer does not occur in any known specimen and is
  skipped with a debug log line, as is any other unrecognised section.

    docstring for the full construct-by-construct mapping and the fidelity
    rules.

    **Usage follows the standard loader two-phase pattern:**

    1. ``loader.load(path)`` — parse one IEEE 1599 file into curated tables.
    2. ``loader.create_bundle()`` — assemble the AlignmentBundle.
    3. ``loader.create_timeline(uid)`` / ``create_timelines()`` — retrieve
       individual timelines (built once, then cached).

    The parse phase fills a
    :class:`~timetoalign.storage.store.DictStore` with one curated table per

    ``structural`` — rather than the generic tag-flattening its ``XmlLoader``
