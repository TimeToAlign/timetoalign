"""ListenHereLoader: a dense audio-to-audio AlignmentBundle from one JSON file.

A *Listen Here!* alignment export is a single JSON file describing how many
recordings of one musical work line up in time.  Every recording is warped onto
a shared, equidistant **reference grid**: the file stores, per recording, a
``times`` array whose ``i``-th entry is that recording's clock-time (in seconds)
at reference-grid column ``i``.  Because every recording is sampled against the
same grid, the per-recording arrays are **parallel and equal length** — together
they form a dense alignment matrix of shape ``(recordings × grid columns)``.

Unlike a pairwise score-to-performance export (one score against one
performance), a single Listen Here! file already encodes the alignment of *all*
recordings against one another.  The natural Time To Align! reading is therefore
a **complete pairwise topology**: at every grid column, every unordered pair of
recordings ``(a, b)`` is directly related by a synchronous instant
:class:`~timetoalign.alignment.claims.MatchClaim`
(``a@times_a[i] ↔ b@times_b[i]``).  For ``R`` recordings and ``N`` grid columns
this is ``C(R, 2) × N`` claims — a very large set for a whole work — so the
claims are held columnar in a
:class:`~timetoalign.alignment.claims.MatchClaimField` and assembled
**vectorized** (never one Python claim object per row).

``ListenHereLoader`` ingests one alignment JSON file in one call::

    bundle = ListenHereLoader.from_file(alignment_json).create_bundle()

and produces a single :class:`~timetoalign.alignment.bundle.AlignmentBundle`:

* one samples
  :class:`~timetoalign.timelines.types.DiscretePhysicalTimeline`
  (``<stem>:dpt1``) per recording, each in its **own** group, with
  ``length`` converted from that recording's stored ``duration``.  The recordings
  carry one point event for each source-grid time.  Its integer sample
  coordinate supports the alignment, while its ``seconds`` field preserves the
  verbatim JSON value; all pairwise alignment lives in the cross-group claim
  field; and
* the complete-topology pairwise claims, reached through the uniform field
  API ``loader.get_field(MatchClaim)`` -> :class:`MatchClaimField`.

The reference recording named by ``header.ref`` fixes the grid origin but is
**not** a privileged hub: it is just another recording, related to every other
by direct pairwise claims like any other pair.

The loader reads the *existing* alignment; it never runs an aligner.

A recording's early grid columns may carry **negative** seconds — a recording
that begins after the reference's grid origin is extrapolated backwards before
its first onset.  These negative coordinates are stored faithfully, neither
clamped nor dropped.
