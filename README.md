# TimeToAlign!

[![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.5334%2Ftismir.296-blue)](https://doi.org/10.5334/tismir.296)

This library is described in the TISMIR article *Time to Align! Modelling Musical Timelines for Music Information Retrieval and Digital Musicology* (2026): https://doi.org/10.5334/tismir.296.

A Python library for representing and aligning musical timelines.

**Documentation:** https://timetoalign.github.io/ · **Source:** https://github.com/timetoalign/timetoalign

## Installation

```bash
pip install timetoalign         # Core only — lightweight
```

The core install pulls in only PyArrow, pandas, NetworkX,
typing_extensions, and pydantic.  This gives you the full timeline / map /
alignment framework but no file-format-specific loaders.  If you need loaders,
plotting, or Jupyter support, install one of the [optional extras](#optional-dependencies)
described below.  To run the **tutorial notebooks** (see below), for example:

```bash
pip install "timetoalign[tutorial]"    # Loaders + plotting + Jupyter
```

### Optional Dependencies

TimeToAlign! organises its optional dependencies into *atomic* extras
(one concern each) and *composite* extras (convenience bundles that
include several atomic ones).  You can mix and match freely:
`pip install "timetoalign[midi,plot]"` is perfectly valid.

#### Atomic extras

Each atomic extra adds support for a single loader backend or feature.

| Extra | Packages | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `midi` | `mido` | MIDI file loading (`PerformanceMidiLoader`) |
| `partitura` | `partitura` | Score parsing via partitura (`PartituraLoader`, `ScoreMidiLoader`) |
| `music21` | `music21` | Score parsing via music21 (`Music21Loader`) |
| `ms3` | `ms3` | DCML TSV score parsing (`Ms3Loader`) |
| `audio` | `soundfile`, `mutagen` | Audio file loading + MP3/M4A metadata |
| `graphical` | `pymupdf`, `pillow` | PDF/image loading & drawing |
| `plot` | `matplotlib` | Visualisation |
| `delta` | `deltalake` | Delta Lake columnar storage (future) |
| `rdf` | `rdflib` | RDF / linked-data export (future) |
| `examples` | `pooch` | On-demand fetching of bundled corpora |

#### Composite extras

Composite extras are convenience bundles that pull in several atomic
extras at once.  Runtime levels include everything below them; `docs`
and `testing` target documentation builds and test-suite execution.

| Extra | Includes | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `scores` | `partitura`, `music21`, `ms3` | All score-loader backends |
| `loaders` | `midi`, `scores`, `audio`, `graphical` | Every loader dependency |
| `tutorial` | `loaders`, `plot`, `examples`, plus `jupytext`, `jupyter` | Everything needed for the tutorial notebooks |
| `docs` | `tutorial`, plus `quartodoc`, `griffe` | Documentation site building |
| `all` | `tutorial`, `delta`, `rdf` | All runtime features |
| `testing` | `all`, `examples`, plus `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `pytest-xdist`, `pytest-benchmark`, `hypothesis` | Test-suite execution |

The inclusion chain is:

```
all  ⊃  tutorial  ⊃  loaders  ⊃  { midi, scores, audio, graphical }
                                 +  plot, examples, jupytext, jupyter
                   +  delta, rdf

docs     ⊃  tutorial, quartodoc, griffe
testing  ⊃  all, examples, pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-xdist, pytest-benchmark, hypothesis
```

#### Examples

```bash
pip install timetoalign                  # Core only
pip install "timetoalign[midi]"          # Core + MIDI loading
pip install "timetoalign[partitura]"     # Core + partitura score parsing
pip install "timetoalign[scores]"        # Core + all score-loader backends
pip install "timetoalign[loaders]"       # Core + every loader
pip install "timetoalign[tutorial]"      # Loaders + plotting + Jupyter
pip install "timetoalign[docs]"          # Tutorial stack + documentation build tools
pip install "timetoalign[testing]"       # Runtime features + test tools
pip install "timetoalign[all]"           # All runtime features
```

### Development install

Contributing or running the test suite requires an editable, source
install with the `dev` extra:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timetoalign/timetoalign.git
pip install -e "./timetoalign[dev]"      # Editable install + everything + dev tooling
```

## Quick Start

```python
import timetoalign as tta

# Create a 60-second audio timeline
audio = tta.ContinuousPhysicalTimeline(length=60.0, uid="audio", name="Piano Recording")

# Add beats and notes -- IDs and temporal_type are inferred automatically
audio.add_events([
    {"event_type": "Beat", "instant": 0.0},
    {"event_type": "Beat", "instant": 0.5},
    {"event_type": "Beat", "instant": 1.0},
    {"event_type": "Note", "start": 0.0, "end": 0.5},
    {"event_type": "Note", "start": 8.0, "end": 12.0},   # spans Intro -> Verse
])

# Nest children (sections of the same recording)
intro  = audio.create_child(length=10.0, offset=0.0,  uid="intro",  name="Intro")
verse  = audio.create_child(length=20.0, offset=10.0, uid="verse",  name="Verse")
chorus = audio.create_child(length=15.0, offset=30.0, uid="chorus", name="Chorus")

# Attach ConversionMaps (seconds -> milliseconds, seconds -> samples at 48 kHz)
audio.add_conversion_map(tta.ScalarMap(scalar=1000, source_unit="seconds", target_unit="milliseconds"))
audio.add_conversion_map(tta.SecondsToSamples(sample_rate=48000))

# The diagram shows the hierarchy at a glance
print(audio.diagram())
```

```
ContinuousPhysicalTimeline[audio] (5 events, 3 children, 2 cmaps)
                      0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 60 seconds
  ├─ Intro            0 ~~~~~                               10
  ├─ Verse           10      ~~~~~~~~~~~~                   30
  └─ Chorus          30                  ~~~~~~~~~          45
```

```python
# A TimeStamp is a cross-section through the entire hierarchy at a given coordinate.
# Only children whose span covers the coordinate appear:
ts = audio.get_timestamp(25.0)
print(ts)
```

```
TimeStamp @25 seconds
  audio         25 seconds
  verse         15 seconds
  milliseconds  25000 milliseconds
  samples       1200000 samples
```

```python
# A TimeIntervalStamp gives the cross-section for a [start, end) range.
# The note at [8, 12) straddles Intro [0, 10) and Verse [10, 30):
# its start falls in Intro, its end in Verse.
tis = audio.get_interval_stamp(8.0, 12.0)
print(tis)
```

```
TimeIntervalStamp [8, 12) seconds
                 start     end
  audio              8      12 seconds
  intro              8       - seconds
  verse              -       2 seconds
  milliseconds    8000   12000
  samples       384000  576000
```

```bash
jupytext --sync docs/*-notebooks/*.py
jupyter notebook docs/tuto-notebooks/
```

## Development

```bash
# Run the test suite
pytest

# Run linting / pre-commit hooks
tox -e lint
```

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| AlignmentAnchor | A set of TimeStamps corresponding to matched events, representing their temporal equivalence across timelines. From a MatchClaim for TimeIntervalEvents, the library derives a start anchor and end anchor. |
| AlignmentBundle | The primary container object that manages a collection of timelines, their groupings, and transfers between them. |
| BeatGrid | A specialized *ContinuousLogicalTimeline* representing metrical structure (measures and beats) using quarter notes as the underlying coordinate unit. |
| Break | A control event that voids contiguity at its Instant. TimeIntervals cannot span a Break, and Breaks cannot be inserted into existing TimeIntervals. |
| ChainMap | A composed ConversionMap that applies multiple ConversionMaps in sequence, creating a conversion path from source to target unit. |
| Child | A timeline nested within a parent timeline, sharing the same measuring unit. Children are locked upon insertion to prevent side effects from modifications. |
| CombinationMap | A ConversionMap that yields outputs from multiple ConversionMaps simultaneously, such as (x, y) coordinate pairs. |
| Commensurable | Two timelines are commensurable when connected by a match path or ConversionMap chain, enabling coordinate translation between them. |
| Composite map | An umbrella concept for ConversionMaps composed from other maps, including ChainMap, CombinationMap, and PiecewiseMap. |
| Contiguity | A TimeInterval is contiguous if it monotonically spans all coordinates between its start and end. An Instant is contiguous with a TimeInterval if it is synchronous with its EndInstant. |
| Control Event | An event affecting flow control: either a Break (voiding contiguity) or a Jump (creating new contiguity). |
| ConversionMap | A function mapping any coordinate to at most one value (another coordinate, specifier, or constant). Also called C-map. |
| Coordinate | A position on a timeline, expressed as the distance from the origin in the timeline's measuring unit. |
| Discrete/Continuous | A timeline is discrete when coordinates exist only at discrete points (e.g., pixels, samples); continuous otherwise (e.g., seconds, quarters). |
| Domain | One of three temporal categories: Graphical (visual/spatial), Logical (symbolic/musical), or Physical (audio/sound). |
| Event | Anything associated with a timeline via Instants. An InstantEvent has zero duration; a TimeIntervalEvent has duration defined by start and end coordinates. |
| FlowControlElement | A taxonomy of control events distinguishing between structural markers (e.g., *repeat_start*, *double_barline*) and jump instructions (e.g., *dal_segno*, *to_coda*). |
| FlowMap | A sequence of TimeIntervals representing a specific traversal path through a timeline, handling Jumps and repeats. |
| GroupTimestamp | A view object representing a synchronized instant across all commensurable timelines within a *TimelineGroup*. |
| IdCoordinate | A coordinate specification that explicitly includes the unique identifier of the timeline to which it belongs, preventing ambiguity in multi-timeline contexts. |
| Instant | Associates a coordinate with a signification such as "start of event e". Instants sharing a coordinate are synchronous. |
| InterpolationMap | A *ConversionMap* that performs coordinate conversion via linear interpolation between a set of known correspondence points. |
| Inverse map | The reverse transformation of a bijective ConversionMap. |
| Jump | A control event with JumpFrom and JumpTo Instants. When active, makes events at JumpTo contiguous with those ending at JumpFrom (e.g., repeats, *dal segno*). |
| Length | The distance between a timeline's origin and its last Instant. A locked timeline cannot extend its length. |
| LinearMap | A *ConversionMap* implementing an affine transformation, f(x) = ax + b. Includes *ScalarMap* (b=0) and *ShiftMap* (a=1) as special cases. |
| MatchClaim | A claim — issued by a human or algorithmic agent — that events from disparate timelines are synchronous or equivalent, carrying provenance metadata (agent, criteria, certainty) and comprising one (instant) or two (interval) AlignmentAnchors. |
| MatchLine | An ordered line that links MatchClaim objects through MatchStamps, enabling selection and alignment of temporal correspondences. |
| MatchMetadata | Structured provenance information attached to a *MatchClaim*, recording the agent, decision criteria, and certainty level of the match. |
| Match path | A graph traversal connecting matched events across multiple timelines, for example A -> B -> C. |
| MetricMap | A specialized *ConversionMap* that handles complex metrical conversions (e.g., quarter notes to measure count) accounting for time signatures and anacrusis. |
| Origin | The zero coordinate of a timeline, from which all positions are measured. |
| PiecewiseMap | A ConversionMap that applies different sub-maps to disjoint coordinate intervals. |
| Region | A named part of a timeline defined by a TimeInterval (e.g., "Chorus", "Verse"). Regions are not timelines and cannot hold events or maps directly. |
| RotationMap | A *ConversionMap* that implements periodic or cyclic transformations using modular arithmetic. |
| Segment | A Child timeline that is contiguous with its siblings. A SegmentLine is a parent containing only contiguous Segments. |
| Synchrony | Strict synchrony: Instants sharing identical coordinates. Pragmatic synchrony: Instants binned together based on a threshold (e.g., for quantisation). |
| Time interval | Defined by a StartInstant and EndInstant; left-inclusive and right-exclusive [s, e). The EndInstant's coordinate must be >= the StartInstant's. |
| Timeline | A positive coordinate axis minimally defined by its origin and measuring unit. Accommodates events and potentially Children. |
| TimelineGroup | A container for a set of commensurable timelines that are bijectively mapped to each other (e.g., via linear interpolation) and share a common timestamp table. |
| TimeStamp | A cross-section through a timeline hierarchy, comprising the root coordinate, synchronous Child coordinates, and all ConversionMap results. |
| WarpMap | A derived timeline where coordinates are re-adjusted based on AlignmentAnchors to align with another timeline. |
