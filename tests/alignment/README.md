# Alignment Module Tests - Validation Strategy

This document explains **why** the test suite provides evidence that the alignment code is correct, following the TimeToAlign! Zero Tolerance Validation Policy.

## Test Philosophy

The alignment module implements TimeToAlign's multi-level hierarchy:

```
AlignmentAnchor (atomic) -> MatchClaim (low) -> MatchGraph (mid) -> MatchLine (high)
        |                        |
        v                        v
   start/end params         TimelineGroup (timestamp table)
```

**NOTE:** TimelineGroup uses a timestamp-based architecture where alignment is
specified via `start`/`end` parameters to `add_timeline()`. Its tests live in
`tests/timelines/test_groups.py`; alignment tests cover consumers of groups.

Each test validates a **specific claim** from the TimeToAlign model. Tests are not exploratory--they verify exact behaviors required by the model.

``WarpMap`` follows the same value-facing vocabulary as the conversion-map
family: calling the map or ``convert_array`` converts values, while
``inverse()`` returns a cached map with swapped source and target identities.
The tests therefore validate inverse values through the returned map and also
assert reciprocal cache identity, rather than treating ``inverse`` as a
value-conversion method.

---

## Shared Test Fixtures (`conftest.py`)

All Thoresen test data constants and shared fixtures are centralised in `tests/alignment/conftest.py`. Individual test files import from conftest rather than defining their own copies.

### Centralised Constants

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `DGT1_SEGMENT_LENGTH` | 967 | Pixels per DGT1 segment (x1 - x0 = 969 - 2) |
| `DGT1_TOTAL_WIDTH` | 4835 | Total DGT1 width (5 × 967) |
| `DGT2_SEGMENT_LENGTHS` | [866, 867, 867, 864, 864] | Per-segment widths for DGT2 |
| `DGT2_TOTAL_WIDTH` | 4328 | Total DGT2 width |
| `AUDIO_DURATION_SECONDS` | 150.0 | Shared audio reference duration |
| `THORESEN_TEST_EVENTS` | 11 events | All events from `thoresen_test.tsv` |

### Centralised Fixtures

| Fixture | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `dgt1_timeline` | `DiscreteGraphicalTimeline` | DGT1 (2009): 4835 px, uid="dgt1" |
| `dgt2_timeline` | `DiscreteGraphicalTimeline` | DGT2 (2010): 4328 px, uid="dgt2" |
| `audio_timeline` | `ContinuousPhysicalTimeline` | 150 seconds, uid="audio" |
| `thoresen_segment_claims` | `list[MatchClaim]` | 5 interval claims mapping DGT1↔DGT2 segments |
| `dgt1_bundle` / `dgt2_bundle` | `GraphicalBundle` | Full graphical bundles (requires PyMuPDF) |

### ID Reset (`autouse=True`)

The `reset_ids` fixture in `conftest.py` has `autouse=True` and resets **all** ID generators (anchor, claim, group, bundle) before every test. This ensures test isolation without individual test files needing their own reset fixtures.

### Migration Note

Previously, `dgt1_timeline`, `dgt2_timeline`, `audio_timeline`, `thoresen_segment_claims`, and the DGT1/DGT2 coordinate constants were duplicated across `test_thoresen_poc.py`, `test_graph.py`, and `test_matchline.py`. These have been consolidated into `conftest.py` so that all test files share a single source of truth.

## TimelineGroup Architecture

### Timestamp Table Design

The group stores alignment data as a PyArrow table:

```
| dgt1_image | dgt1_holes | dlt1_raw |
|------------|------------|----------|
| 0.0        | null       | null     |  <- group start (image only)
| 15343.0    | 0.0        | 0.0      |  <- musical region starts
| 293119.0   | 277776.0   | 871800.0 |  <- musical region ends
| 299400.0   | null       | null     |  <- group end (image only)
```

Between any two adjacent rows, ALL non-null timelines have bijective linear mapping.

### Coordinate and Filter Canonicalisation

Alignment coordinate-entry APIs preserve ``Coordinate`` and ``IdCoordinate``
units until the receiving timeline resolves them. Native-unit inputs retain
their value, C-Map-afforded units convert to the timeline's native unit, and
unafforded units raise ``ValueError`` rather than being silently reduced to a
number. An ``IdCoordinate`` must agree with an explicitly supplied timeline
ID. Graph, match-line, and stamp timeline filters use the common
``timeline_ids`` and ``id_pattern`` vocabulary; both constraints must pass.
The tests cover failed and C-Map-backed bundle queries, ID conflicts, and
equivalent graph, group-extension, match-line, and stamp filtering results.

### Key Changes from PerfectAlignment

| Before (deprecated) | After |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| `PerfectAlignment(source_start=0, source_end=277776, ref_start=15343, ref_end=293119)` | `group.add_timeline(holes, start=IdCoordinate(15343.0, TimeUnit.seconds, "dgt1"), end=IdCoordinate(293119.0, TimeUnit.seconds, "dgt1"))` |
| Per-timeline alignment objects | Timestamp table with one field per timeline |
| `group.reference_timeline_id` | Reference timeline is first field in table |

---

## Transitive Cross-Group Union & Support Policy (`test_transitive_support.py`)

### What We're Validating

`AlignmentBundle.get_matchstamp_at` assembles the **transitive cross-group
union** reachable from the query, and governs out-of-support transfers with a
`support_policy` (`omit` / `clamp` / `extrapolate`, default `omit`). Two
properties are proven with a synthetic fixture that owns no corpus data:

1. A query reaches **every** timeline of **both** merged bundles, including
   timelines that are only reachable through a bridge timeline, and only after
   that bridge timeline's derived-unit coordinate is reconciled to its native
   alignment unit.
2. A coordinate below the first alignment anchor produces **no negative
   coordinate under any policy**, and the three policies produce exact,
   distinct results.

### Synthetic Fixture Topology

Two bundles are built, then merged with `AlignmentBundle.from_bundles`, then
bridged with `create_match_claims`:

- **Bundle A — a star in the per-claim list.** `a1` (score, quarters, len 100),
  `a2` (seconds, len 100), `a3` (seconds, len 100), each in its own group.
  Cross-group `MatchClaim`s at `a1` coordinates `{0, 50, 100}`:
  `a2 = a1` and `a3 = a1 / 2`. A query at `a1 = 50` reaches `a2 = 50`,
  `a3 = 25` by exact anchor.
- **Bundle B — a WarpMap-able columnar `MatchClaimField`.** `b_bridge`
  (samples, len 1000) carrying a `ScalarMap(0.01, samples→seconds)` C-Map,
  plus `b1` (samples, len 3000) and `b2` (samples, len 3000), each in its own
  group. The field holds native-samples instant anchors:

  | `b_bridge` (samples) | `b1` (samples) | `b2` (samples) |
  |---|---|---|
  | 200 | 100 | 300 |
  | 400 | 900 | 600 |
  | 600 | 1700 | 900 |
  | 800 | 2500 | 1200 |

  The field's `b_bridge` hull is therefore `[200, 800]`.
- **Bridge A↔B.** `create_match_claims` anchors `a1 = 50` to `b_bridge = 5`.
  Because `b_bridge`'s native unit is samples, the anchor is recorded as
  `b_bridge = 5` *samples* — a value that is really 5 seconds (the derived
  unit), the same "seconds-on-a-samples-timeline" shape as the specimen.

### Exact Expected Values

**Union query — `merged.get_matchstamp_at(50, "a1:clt1")` (default `omit`):**

`is_interpolated is False` (the query carries an exact anchor); 6 timelines,
no negatives:

| timeline | coordinate | how |
|---|---|---|
| `a1:clt1` | 50 | query |
| `a2:cpt1` | 50 | exact anchor |
| `a3:cpt2` | 25 | exact anchor |
| `b_bridge:dpt1` | 5 | exact bridge anchor (unaltered) |
| `b1:dpt2` | 1300 | reconcile 5 s → 500 samples, warp → 1300 |
| `b2:dpt3` | 750 | reconcile 5 s → 500 samples, warp → 750 |

`b_bridge = 5` is out of the field hull `[200, 800]`; its C-Map inverse
reinterprets 5 seconds as 500 samples (in hull), and `np.interp(500, …)` gives
`b1 = 1300`, `b2 = 750`.

**Parity.** `b_bundle.get_matchstamp_at(500, "b_bridge:dpt1")` (the reconciled
native coordinate) yields `b1 = 1300`, `b2 = 750` — identical to the union's B
portion for the transferred timelines.

**Out-of-support query — `merged.get_matchstamp_at(50, "b_bridge:dpt1")`** (50
samples, below the hull; the query's own coordinate is never reconciled):

| policy | timelines | `b1:dpt2` | `b2:dpt3` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `omit` | 1 (`b_bridge` only) | — | — |
| `clamp` | 3 | 100 (`warp(200)`) | 300 (`warp(200)`) |
| `extrapolate` | 3 | 0 (`warp(50) = -500`, floored) | 75 (`warp(50)`, kept) |

`b_bridge = 50` stays present and unaltered under every policy. `a1/a2/a3` are
unreachable from `b_bridge` (the single bridge pair cannot form a WarpMap, which
needs at least two anchors), which keeps the out-of-support counts exact.

---

## TimelineGroup Integration

### What We're Validating

Groups contain timelines with "perfect alignment"--any coordinate in one timeline maps to exactly one coordinate in every other timeline.

### Key Test Classes

| Class | Tests |
|-------|-------|
| `TestGroupTimestamp` | View object creation, coordinate access, `present_timelines` property, `_repr_html_` coordinate table + affordance `Try` footer (`ts[<tl_id>]` / `ts.get(<tl_id>)`) |
| `TestTimelineGroupCreation` | Empty groups, groups with initial timelines, ID generation |
| `TestTimelineGroupAddTimeline` | Linear alignment, partial alignment with `start`/`end`, duplicate detection |
| `TestTimelineGroupTimestamps` | Timestamp count, boundary retrieval, table structure |
| `TestTimelineGroupInterpolation` | `get_timestamp_at()` for exact matches and interior points |
| `TestTimelineGroupConversion` | `convert()` method, same-timeline identity, cross-timeline mapping |
| `TestTimelineGroupLocking` | Lock/unlock, `allow_extension` parameter |
| `TestBackwardCompatibility` | Deprecated `from_reference()` and `iter_timelines()` methods |
| `TestTimelineGroupUnifiedTimestamp` | Unified TimeStamp API, InterpolationMap-based coordinate resolution |
| `TestTimestampAccess.test_row_timestamp_stamp_contract` | Group row views share the Stamp contract: exact Coordinate value/unit, unit-name subscript fallback, flat materialization, and group source metadata |
| `TestTimestampAccess.test_old_timestamp_accessor_is_absent` | The row-index accessor is `get_timestamp_at_index()`; the coordinate-oriented `get_timestamp` name is not available on groups |

### Key Evidence

| Test | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| `test_add_with_partial_alignment` | Partial ranges work: `start=IdCoordinate(15343, TimeUnit.seconds, "dgt1")` maps holes 0 -> image 15343 |
| `test_interpolation_exact_boundary` | Exact boundary coordinates return stored values (no interpolation) |
| `test_interpolation_interior_point` | Interior points are linearly interpolated |
| `test_conversion_same_timeline` | Self-conversion returns input unchanged (reflexivity) |
| `test_conversion_cross_timeline` | **Core functionality**: Coordinate conversion via timestamp lookup |
| `test_floating_point_precision` | Boundary values are EXACT (no floating-point error from interpolation round-trip) |

### The Floating-Point Precision Test

```python
def test_floating_point_precision(self):
    # Partial alignment: holes [0, 277776] -> image [15343, 293119]
    group.add_timeline(
        holes,
        start=IdCoordinate(15343.0, TimeUnit.seconds, "dgt1"),
        end=IdCoordinate(293119.0, TimeUnit.seconds, "dgt1"),
    )

    # Boundary coordinates must be EXACT
    result = group.convert(0.0, source="holes", target="dgt1")
    assert result == 15343.0  # EXACT, not pytest.approx()
```

This test validates that the source timeline's coordinate is stored exactly, not computed through interpolation (which would introduce floating-point error).

---

## Unified TimeStamp API Tests (`test_groups.py::TestTimelineGroupUnifiedTimestamp`)

### What We're Validating

The unified `TimeStamp` architecture has both `Timeline` (with children) and `TimelineGroup` (with member timelines) using the same coordinate resolution mechanism via `InterpolationMap`. This enables O(log n) coordinate conversion without table scans.

### Key API

```python
from timetoalign.core import TimeStamp, TimeIntervalStamp

# TimelineGroup unified API
group = TimelineGroup(id="my_group", timelines=[audio, dgt])
ts = group.get_unified_timestamp(75.0, "audio")
ts["dgt"]                  # Converted coordinate via InterpolationMap
ts.axis                    # 75.0 (source coordinate)
ts.source_id               # "audio"

# Interval stamps
interval = group.get_unified_interval_stamp(0.0, 100.0, "audio")
interval.duration          # 100.0
interval["dgt"]            # (start, end) tuple on dgt timeline
```

### Key Evidence

| Test | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| `test_get_unified_timestamp_basic` | Creates valid `TimeStamp` object with correct axis and source_id |
| `test_get_unified_timestamp_coordinate_conversion` | Converts coordinates between timelines via InterpolationMap |
| `test_get_unified_timestamp_bidirectional` | Conversion works in both directions (audio->dgt and dgt->audio) |
| `test_get_unified_timestamp_unknown_timeline_raises` | KeyError for unknown timeline IDs |
| `test_get_unified_interval_stamp` | Creates `TimeIntervalStamp` with correct duration and interval conversion |
| `test_unified_timestamp_with_three_timelines` | Coordinate conversion works with 3+ timelines |
| `test_unified_timestamp_same_timeline_returns_axis` | Subscript with source ID returns axis value |
| `test_interpolation_maps_built_on_add` | Maps are built automatically when timelines are added |
| `test_interpolation_maps_updated_on_remove` | Maps are rebuilt when timelines are removed |
| `test_implements_timestamp_source_protocol` | TimelineGroup implements `TimeStampSource` protocol |
| `test_get_related_timeline_ids` | `_get_related_timeline_ids()` returns all timeline IDs |
| `test_get_available_units_returns_empty` | Groups don't have C-Maps (empty list) |

### InterpolationMap Management

The TimelineGroup maintains a dictionary of pairwise `InterpolationMap` objects:

```python
group._interpolation_maps = {
    "audio:dgt1": InterpolationMap(...),  # audio -> dgt1
    "dgt1:audio": InterpolationMap(...),  # dgt1 -> audio
    "audio:score": InterpolationMap(...), # audio -> score
    ...
}
```

Maps are:
- **Built** when `add_timeline()` is called (for all pairwise combinations)
- **Rebuilt** when `remove_timeline()` is called (removing invalidated maps)
- **Used** by `get_unified_timestamp()` for O(log n) coordinate lookup

### Relationship to Timeline TimeStamp

The same `TimeStamp` class works for both:

| Source | Method | Child/Member Access |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| `Timeline` | `get_timestamp(coord)` | `ts["child:id"]` via offset subtraction |
| `TimelineGroup` | `get_unified_timestamp(coord, source_id)` | `ts["other_id"]` via InterpolationMap |

Both implement the `TimeStampSource` protocol, enabling code reuse.

---

## AlignmentAnchor Tests (`test_anchors.py::TestAlignmentAnchor`)

### What We're Validating

**Design:** AlignmentAnchor is a **pure coordinate pair** — a neutral record associating one coordinate on timeline A with one coordinate on timeline B. It contains no claim semantics (`is_synchronous`, `is_explicit`, `id` fields were removed). Claim semantics live exclusively on `MatchClaim`.

`AlignmentAnchor` is a **frozen pydantic v2 `BaseModel`** whose coordinates are
unit-bearing `Coordinate` values. Tests cover both the public scalar contract and
the claim-specific Arrow projection: coordinate values retain exact `Fraction`
representations, each side retains its per-row unit, and mixed-unit anchors survive
field storage and materialisation without changing their numeric values.

### Key Evidence

| Test | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| `test_basic_creation` | Anchor stores two timeline IDs and two required `Coordinate` scalars (no raw-float coercion or semantic flags) |
| `test_connects` / `test_connects_both` | Query methods correctly identify connected timelines |
| `test_get_coordinate_for` | Coordinate retrieval preserves the exact value and unit |
| `test_from_dict_roundtrip` | Nested coordinate dictionaries round-trip exactly (no legacy flat-float shape) |
| `test_fraction_roundtrip` / mixed-unit field tests | `Fraction(7, 3)` and independent quarters/seconds units survive `MatchClaimField` Arrow storage and materialisation |
| `test_frozen_model` | Immutability enforced (frozen pydantic model) |

### Why Immutability Matters

```python
def test_frozen_model(self):
    with pytest.raises(ValidationError):
        basic_anchor.coordinate_a = 200.0
```

Anchors are value objects — identified entirely by their coordinates. Immutability prevents subtle bugs where coordinate modifications propagate unexpectedly through a MatchGraph. (A frozen pydantic model raises `pydantic.ValidationError` on attribute assignment.)

---

## MatchClaim Tests (`test_anchors.py::TestMatchClaim`)

### What We're Validating

**Design:** MatchClaim has `timeline_a_id` and `timeline_b_id` as **top-level fields** (not derived from anchors). Anchors are `Optional` — only synchronous claims have them. Four case-specific constructors:

| Constructor | Case | Synchronous | Anchors |
|-------------|------|-------------|---------|
| `from_events()` | Two timed events correspond | Yes (default) | Auto-built from event coordinates |
| `from_projection()` | Event projected onto timeline | Yes | Auto-built from event + target coord |
| `nomatch()` | Event has no equivalent | No | None |
| `implicit()` | Generated by MatchGraph extension | Yes | From given coordinates |

**Constructor history:** Legacy constructors `instant()` and `interval()` were removed. All 72 call sites across 6 test files and `table_schema.py` were migrated to direct `MatchClaim()` construction with explicit `AlignmentAnchor` objects.

### Key Evidence

| Test | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| `test_instant_creation` | Single anchor → `is_interval == False`, timeline IDs are top-level |
| `test_interval_creation` | Two anchors → `is_interval == True` |
| `test_mismatched_anchors_raises` | **Critical invariant**: Start and end anchors must connect same timeline pair |
| `test_synchronous_requires_anchor` | `__post_init__` rejects synchronous claims without anchors |
| `test_non_synchronous_rejects_anchors` | `__post_init__` rejects non-synchronous claims with anchors |
| `test_get_coordinates_for_interval` | Can retrieve both start and end coords for each timeline |
| `test_from_events_constructor` | `from_events()` builds anchor from event coordinates |
| `test_nomatch_constructor` | `nomatch()` has no anchors, `is_synchronous=False` |
| `test_implicit_constructor` | `implicit()` records `source_claim_id` for traceability |

### NOMATCH Coordinate Preservation & Repr

A NOMATCH claim records the *unmatched source-side coordinate* in a
`source_coordinate` field. Synchronous claims leave it `None` because their
coordinate already lives on the anchor (minimal-schema: the coordinate is
stored once, never duplicated). `nomatch()` extracts it from
`event["start"]`; `to_dict()`/`from_dict()` round-trip it so a serialised
NOMATCH claim reconstructs identically.

The `__repr__` of a NOMATCH claim shows that coordinate next to the source
timeline and tags the claim with the flag word `NOMATCH` (not the internal
field name "non-synchronous"). When no source coordinate is known the repr
falls back to the bare timeline id.

| Test | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| `test_repr_non_synchronous` | NOMATCH claim repr carries the `NOMATCH` flag and never the literal "non-synchronous" |
| `test_repr_nomatch_with_coordinate_exact` | Exact string `MatchClaim(score:clt1@188.8 <-> perf:Chopin_Ashkenazy [NOMATCH])`; `source_coordinate.value == 188.8` with the source unit |
| `test_repr_nomatch_without_coordinate` | No `start` in the event ⇒ `source_coordinate is None` and repr drops the `@coord` segment |
| `test_nomatch_source_coordinate_roundtrip` | `from_dict(to_dict())` preserves `source_coordinate` and equals the original |
| `test_repr_synchronous_instant_unchanged` | Regression guard: a synchronous instant repr is byte-for-byte unchanged and its `source_coordinate is None` |

These assertions are exact strings (ZERO TOLERANCE), pinning both the new
NOMATCH form and the unchanged synchronous form.

### The Mismatch Test in Detail

```python
def test_mismatched_anchors_raises(self):
    start = AlignmentAnchor(timeline_a_id="tl1", ..., timeline_b_id="tl2", ...)
    end = AlignmentAnchor(timeline_a_id="tl1", ..., timeline_b_id="tl3", ...)  # Different!

    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="must connect same timelines"):
        MatchClaim(timeline_a_id="tl1", timeline_b_id="tl2",
                   start_anchor=start, end_anchor=end)
```

This prevents creating semantically invalid claims. An interval match between `(tl1, tl2)` and `(tl1, tl3)` would represent... what? The constraint catches this at construction time.

---

## Agent & MatchMetadata Tests (`test_anchors.py::TestMatchMetadata`)

### What We're Validating

A match records who authored it and how confident that author is. The schema
was **slimmed**: `MatchMetadata` is now exactly `{agent: Agent, certainty:
float}`. The previous free-form fields — `decision_criteria`, `created_at`,
`notes`, `algorithm_params` — were **deleted entirely** (no compat shim).

`Agent` is a new frozen pydantic scalar `{name: str, type: AgentType,
identifier: str}`. `AgentType` is a two-member `FancyStrEnum`
(`human`, `software`); the `identifier` is a URI for a human and a version
string for software. Both `Agent` and `MatchMetadata` are frozen pydantic v2
models with `to_dict()` / `from_dict()` round-trips (the `type` member stores
as its string value and is coerced back to `AgentType` on read).

### Key Evidence

| Test | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| `test_agent_type_members` | `AgentType` has exactly `human` and `software` |
| `test_basic_creation` | `MatchMetadata{agent, certainty}`; `certainty` defaults to `1.0` |
| `test_agent_roundtrip` | `Agent.from_dict(agent.to_dict())` reconstructs identically (`type` as string) |
| `test_metadata_roundtrip` | `MatchMetadata.from_dict(meta.to_dict())` reconstructs identically (nested `Agent`) |
| `test_certainty_validation` | Certainty must be in [0, 1] (message: `Certainty must be in [0, 1], got ...`) |
| `test_certainty_boundaries` | Boundary values (0.0, 1.0) are valid |
| `test_frozen_model` | Immutability enforced (frozen pydantic model) |

---

## MatchClaimField Tests (`test_match_claim_field.py`)

### What We're Validating

`MatchClaimField` is a **genuine `SemanticField[MatchClaim]`** — the Field
paired with the `MatchClaim` scalar. It holds a very large set of pairwise
alignment claims in a **single derived struct column** instead of one frozen
`MatchClaim` object per claim. Dense audio-to-audio alignments push this into
the millions of claims, so the store must build vectorized (never one Python
object per row) and materialise individual `MatchClaim` instances only on
demand.

Because `MatchClaim` is now a pydantic scalar, the field's struct schema is
**derived from the scalar** by `derive_arrow_struct(MatchClaim)` and cached on
the class as `MatchClaimField.pa_schema` — exactly like every other paired
`SemanticField` (`NoteField`, `CoordinateField`, …). The `MatchClaim` scalar
carries no `@data_shaped` methods, so the parity check requires no vectorized
mirrors.

Shared provenance is a single `MatchMetadata | None` held **once at field
level** (a Python attribute, `self._metadata`) and **injected on read**. This
mirrors how `CoordinateField` carries its `unit` outside the data: the struct
column's `metadata` sub-field is left null in the bulk path, and `__getitem__`
injects the field-level metadata into each materialised `MatchClaim`. This
keeps the store compact (one struct column, no per-row metadata) while the field
remains a real SemanticField. Each anchor coordinate is stored as a nested
`{value, numerator, denominator, unit}` struct so exact rational values and
per-row units survive materialisation.

### Scope (v1) — and what raises

The store holds **synchronous instant pairwise claims only**: each row has
`is_synchronous is True`, a `start_anchor`, and `end_anchor is None`. Two
categories are deliberately out of scope and `from_claims` raises `ValueError`
on either:

- **NOMATCH claims** (`is_synchronous is False`, no anchors).
- **Interval claims** (carry an `end_anchor`).

### Internal schema (the derived `MatchClaim` struct)

The backing table has **one** column, `match_claim`, whose type is exactly
`MatchClaimField.pa_schema == derive_arrow_struct(MatchClaim)`. The vectorized
`from_columns` fills the `timeline_a_id` / `timeline_b_id` top-level string
sub-fields and the `start_anchor` sub-struct
(`{timeline_a_id, coordinate_a, timeline_b_id, coordinate_b}`), sets
`is_synchronous` / `is_explicit` to `True`, and leaves every other sub-field
(`end_anchor`, `metadata`, event ids/names, `source_coordinate`,
`source_claim_id`, `id`) null. It uses `pa.StructArray.from_arrays` and never
materialises a Python `MatchClaim`. The `coordinate_a` / `coordinate_b` values
read back through the `start_anchor` sub-struct; `timeline_ids` reads the two
top-level id sub-fields vectorized.

### Canonical gold vector

```python
agent = Agent(name="test", type=AgentType.software, identifier="manual")
meta = MatchMetadata(agent=agent)
f = MatchClaimField.from_columns(
    timeline_a_ids=["A", "A", "B"],
    timeline_b_ids=["B", "C", "C"],
    coordinate_a=[0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
    coordinate_b=[10.0, 20.0, 21.0],
    unit_a=TimeUnit.quarters,
    unit_b=TimeUnit.seconds,
    metadata=meta,
)
```

### Key Evidence (exact, zero-tolerance)

Claim counts and coordinate values are **identical** to the prior layout; only
the metadata shape and the field's internal column layout changed.

| Test | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| `test_from_columns_length` | `len(f) == 3` |
| `test_is_semantic_field` | `issubclass(MatchClaimField, SemanticField)` |
| `test_pa_schema_is_derived` | `MatchClaimField.pa_schema == derive_arrow_struct(MatchClaim)` |
| `test_table_single_struct_column` | one column `match_claim` whose type equals `pa_schema` |

| `test_filter_timeline_id_equals_connecting` | `filter(timeline_id=...)` matches `connecting(...)` |
| `test_filter_both_none_copies` | `f.filter()` returns all rows |
| `test_filter_and_combination` | `timeline_id` AND `timeline_ids` combine with logical AND |

| `test_repr` | `repr(f) == "MatchClaimField(claims=3, timelines=3)"` |
| `test_repr_html_contains_summary` | `_repr_html_()` is non-empty and reports the claim/timeline counts |

| `test_translator_strenum_to_string` | `derive_arrow_struct(MatchMetadata)` has a string `type` sub-field inside the `agent` struct |

### Vectorized query primitives

Every bundle-level claim query is composed from primitives that live **on the
field**, so the answer is computed over Arrow columns and no `MatchClaim` is
built unless the caller asks for one. These are the primitives, tested against
the canonical gold vector above (three rows, `A↔B`, `A↔C`, `B↔C`).

| Test | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| `test_at_matches_a_side` | `f.at("A", 0.0)` has `len == 2` (rows 0 and 1) |
| `test_at_matches_b_side` | `f.at("C", 20.0)` has `len == 1`, the `A↔C` row |
| `test_at_exact_equality_only` | `f.at("A", 0.0000001)` is empty — no tolerance, no nearest-value fallback |
| `test_at_unknown_timeline_empty` | `f.at("Z", 0.0)` is empty; metadata still carries over |
| `test_at_on_empty_field` | `at` on a zero-row field returns a zero-row field |
| `test_filter_id_pattern` | `filter(id_pattern=r"^A$")` has `len == 2` (rows 0 and 1) |
| `test_filter_id_pattern_no_match` | `filter(id_pattern=r"^Z")` is empty |
| `test_filter_between_order_independent` | `filter(between=("A","B"))` == `filter(between=("B","A"))`, `len == 1` |
| `test_filter_within_requires_both_sides` | `filter(within={"A","B"})` has `len == 1` — `A↔C` and `B↔C` are excluded because only one side is in the set |
| `test_filter_synchronous_only_is_noop` | `filter(synchronous_only=True)` has `len == 3` (class invariant) |
| `test_filter_nomatch_only_is_empty` | `filter(nomatch_only=True)` has `len == 0` (class invariant) |
| `test_filter_mutually_exclusive_raises` | both flags together raise `ValueError` |
| `test_filter_combines_with_and` | `filter(timeline_id="A", between=("A","C"))` has `len == 1` |
| `test_connects_groups_true` | `connects_groups({"A"}, {"C"})` is True |
| `test_connects_groups_order_independent` | `connects_groups({"C"}, {"A"})` is True |
| `test_connects_groups_false` | `connects_groups({"A"}, {"Z"})` is False |
| `test_connects_groups_empty_field` | False on a zero-row field |
| `test_max_coordinate_a_side` / `_b_side` | `max_coordinate("A") == 0.0`, `max_coordinate("C") == 21.0` |
| `test_max_coordinate_spans_both_sides` | `max_coordinate("B") == 10.0` (b-side row 0 = 10.0 beats a-side row 2 = 1.0) |
| `test_max_coordinate_unknown_timeline` | `max_coordinate("Z") is None` |
| `test_coordinate_pairs` | the four bulk lists are exactly `["A","A","B"]`, `["B","C","C"]`, `[0.0,0.0,1.0]`, `[10.0,20.0,21.0]` |
| `test_coordinate_pairs_empty` | four empty lists on a zero-row field |

`within` is the vectorized primitive behind domain- and unit-restricted
queries. `include_domains` / `include_units` cannot live on the field itself —
they need each timeline's domain and unit, which the store does not hold — so
the bundle resolves them into the set of timeline IDs that pass and hands that
set to `within`. The **both sides must be in the set** semantics is not a
choice: it is what `ClaimFilter.matches_claim` already applies to the Python
list, and parity demands the two agree.

---

## Claim-Store Parity (`test_claim_store_parity.py`)

### What We're Validating

`AlignmentBundle` has two claim stores — the per-claim Python list
`cross_group_claims` and the columnar `cross_group_claim_fields`. The contract
is that **which store a claim lives in is invisible to every reader**: a bundle
holding a set of claims in the list and a bundle holding the *same* claims in a
`MatchClaimField` must answer every public getter identically. Only cost
differs.

This matters because a loader may legitimately choose either store, and a
columnar loader must not silently lose query capability. A reader that consults
only one store is a bug, and this suite is what catches it.

### Fixture Topology

Three timelines, one group each (so every claim is cross-group), spanning two
domains so that domain/unit filters bite:

| Bundle UID | Class | Unit | Domain |
|------------|-------|------|--------|
| `score:clt1` | `ContinuousLogicalTimeline` | `quarters` | logical |
| `perf:cpt1` | `ContinuousPhysicalTimeline` | `seconds` | physical |
| `perf:cpt2` | `ContinuousPhysicalTimeline` | `seconds` | physical |

Bundle UIDs equal the actual timeline IDs, sidestepping the UID/actual-ID
key-space split so that a parity failure is never confused with a key-space
artefact.

The claim topology is **complete pairwise at three aligned instants** — every
pair claims at every instant, 3 pairs × 3 instants = **9 synchronous instant
claims**:

| Instant | `score:clt1` | `perf:cpt1` | `perf:cpt2` |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 2.0 |
| 1 | 4.0 | 3.0 | 5.0 |
| 2 | 8.0 | 6.5 | 9.0 |

Each instant is therefore one connected component spanning **all three**
timelines, so `from_graph=True` collapses 9 pairwise rows into 3 cross-section
rows — a non-trivial collapse, not an identity.

The same nine claims are built twice by a factory (fresh objects each time, so
the two bundles never share a claim's `set_bundle` association) and handed to:

- `bundle_list` — via `add_match_claims(claims)`
- `bundle_field` — via `add_match_claim_field(MatchClaimField.from_claims(claims))`

### Comparison Rule

Claim **identity** is not comparable across the two constructions: claims
materialised out of a field are rebuilt from the struct row, so their generated
`id` differs from the original objects', and the field carries provenance once
at field level rather than per claim. What must be identical is the *alignment
content*. Every claim comparison therefore runs on the normalised key

```python
(timeline_a_id, timeline_b_id, coordinate_a, coordinate_b, is_synchronous)
```

sorted, so ordering differences between the two stores also cannot mask a
difference in content. Coordinate values are compared exactly (no tolerance) —
both paths carry the same `float` through, so anything else is a defect.

### Key Evidence (exact, zero-tolerance)

| Test | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| `test_n_cross_group_claims` | both bundles report `9` |
| `test_store_placement` | `bundle_list` has 9 list claims / 0 fields; `bundle_field` has 0 list claims / 1 field of 9 rows (proves the fixture actually tests two different layouts) |
| `test_get_match_claims_unfiltered` | both return 9 claims with equal normalised keys |
| `test_get_match_claims_filtered[…]` | one case per filter kwarg — `timeline_id`, `timeline_ids`, `id_pattern`, `between`, `synchronous_only`, `nomatch_only`, `include_domains`, `include_units`, and an unknown-UID case — equal normalised keys for each, with the exact expected count pinned per case |
| `test_get_claim_fields_row_count_matches_claims` | for every filter case, `sum(len(f) for f in bundle_field.get_claim_fields(**kw))` equals `len(bundle_list.get_match_claims(**kw))` — the vectorized accessor and the materialising one agree |
| `test_get_claim_fields_empty_on_list_bundle` | a list-only bundle returns `[]` (nothing to serve columnar) |
| `test_get_claim_fields_drops_empty_fields` | a filter matching no row yields `[]`, not a zero-row field |
| `test_get_matchstamps` | equal sorted coordinate maps, 9 stamps each |
| `test_matchstamp_table_per_claim` | both: `num_rows == 9`, `column_names == ["perf:cpt1", "perf:cpt2", "score:clt1"]`, and identical `to_pylist()` — each row exactly two non-null cells |
| `test_matchstamp_table_from_graph` | both: `num_rows == 3`, same 3 columns, all 9 cells filled, rows in the documented order (instant 0, 1, 2) with the exact coordinates of the topology table above |
| `test_matchstamp_table_timeline_filter` | `timeline_filter={"score:clt1"}` yields a 1-column table in both modes for both bundles |
| `test_are_commensurable` | all three timeline pairs are commensurable in both bundles; a non-member ID is not |
| `test_get_matchstamp_at` | at each of the three instants, both bundles return a stamp spanning all 3 timelines with the exact coordinates of the topology table |
| `test_transfer_round_trip` | `transfer(4.0, "score:clt1", "perf:cpt1") == 3.0` in both bundles, and the reverse direction returns `4.0` — exercising the `MatchLine` → `WarpMap` path that was dead for columnar bundles |
| `test_diagram_reports_claim_count` | `bundle.diagram()` reports `MatchClaims: 9` for both |

### Collapsed-Row Ordering

`from_graph=True` must be deterministic or the table is not comparable at all.
Components are ordered by the coordinate on the lexicographically smallest
timeline ID present in the component, then by that ID. This is a total order:
two components can never share a `(timeline_id, coordinate)` node, since
sharing one would have unioned them. `test_matchstamp_table_from_graph` pins
the resulting row order explicitly rather than sorting the result, so a change
in the ordering rule fails the suite instead of passing silently.

### Scale sanity (vectorized path, no Python objects)

`test_scale_builds_columnar` builds a field of **100 000** rows via
`from_columns` with deterministic inputs (`coordinate_a = [float(i) for i in
range(100_000)]`), asserting `len == 100_000` and that `f[50_000]` materialises
to the correct coordinate (`50000.0`). Construction completes in well under a
second (≈30 ms locally) because `from_columns` builds Arrow arrays directly and
never instantiates a `MatchClaim`. This is the proof that the columnar path
scales to the dense-alignment workload.

## SUPRA Integration Tests (`test_supra_integration.py`)

### What We're Validating

The SUPRA (Stanford University Piano Roll Archive) tests validate the **partial alignment** feature using real-world data from piano roll digitization. This is the canonical use case for the timestamp-table TimelineGroup API.

### Data Source

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Roll | WM 990 | Welte-Mignon red roll, T-100 |
| DRUID | fd660zf8362 | Stanford Digital Repository ID |
| IMAGE_HEIGHT | 299,400 | Full image height in pixels |
| FIRST_HOLE | 15,343 | Pixel row of first musical hole |
| LAST_HOLE | 293,119 | Pixel row of last musical hole |
| MUSICAL_LENGTH | 277,776 | `last_hole - first_hole` |
| MUSICAL_HOLES | 30,092 | Individual hole punches |
| MUSICAL_NOTES | 8,718 | Notes after merging adjacent holes |

### Test Classes

| Class | Tests |
|-------|-------|
| `TestSUPRADataLoading` | `IIIFManifestLoader` dimensions, `ATONLoader` metadata (EXACT values) |
| `TestSUPRATimelineCreation` | Timeline lengths match loader data |
| `TestSUPRAAlignmentBundle` | Partial alignment via `start`/`end` parameters, coordinate transfer |
| `TestSUPRAOrderIndependence` | Same alignment specifications produce same results regardless of add order |
| `TestSUPRASummary` | Bundle summary structure and determinism |

### Key Evidence

| Test | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| `test_iiif_dimensions_exact` | IIIF loader returns `width=4096, height=299400` (EXACT) |
| `test_aton_metadata_exact` | ATON loader returns EXACT counts from gold standard |
| `test_transfer_holes_to_image` | Holes coord 0 -> Image pixel 15343 (EXACT, no tolerance) |
| `test_transfer_image_to_holes` | Inverse transfer: Image 15343 -> Holes 0 (EXACT) |
| `test_three_timeline_same_partial_alignment` | Three timelines with same partial alignment produce consistent transfers |

### Alignment Diagram

```

```

### ZERO TOLERANCE Policy Compliance

Per the engineering standards:

1. **EXACT COUNTS REQUIRED**: All assertions use exact expected values from the gold standard
2. **NO TOLERANCE**: Boundary coordinates (0, 15343, 293119, 277776) are compared with `==`, not `pytest.approx()`
3. **DOCUMENTED ROOT CAUSE**: Interior point comparisons document why floating-point arithmetic is involved (irrational scale factors)

## Integration Tests

### Thoresen PoC Setup (`test_groups.py::TestGroupIntegration`)

```python
def test_thoresen_poc_setup(self):
    """
    DGT1 (2009): 5 equal segments, 4875 pixels total
    DGT2 (2010): 5 varying segments, 4328 pixels total
    Both map to 150 seconds of audio.
    """
```

This test validates that the Group infrastructure can model the Thoresen proof-of-concept discussed in the TISMIR article (https://doi.org/10.5334/tismir.296). It creates two independent groups (DGT1+audio, DGT2+audio) and verifies coordinate conversions match expected values. The `dgt1_timeline`, `dgt2_timeline`, and `audio_timeline` fixtures are provided by `conftest.py`.

**Why exact values**: The pixel counts (4875, 4328) and segment lengths come from the published Thoresen example (constants centralised in `conftest.py`). The test verifies that our implementation produces the same results described there.

### Thoresen Segment Claims (`test_anchors.py::TestClaimIntegration`)

```python
def test_thoresen_segment_claims(self):
    """Creates 5 interval MatchClaims for segment correspondence."""
    # Constants from conftest.py:
    # DGT1_SEGMENT_LENGTH = 967 (5 equal segments)
    # DGT2_SEGMENT_LENGTHS = [866, 867, 867, 864, 864]
```

This test validates that MatchClaims can represent the segment-to-segment correspondence needed for the Thoresen PoC. The `thoresen_segment_claims` fixture (defined in `conftest.py`) builds the claims from the centralised DGT1/DGT2 constants. It verifies:
- All 5 claims are intervals (not instants)
- All claims connect the same timeline pair
- Cumulative offsets are correct (first segment starts at 0, last ends at total length)

---

## Offset Arithmetic Tests (`../timelines/test_offset_arithmetic.py`)

### What We're Validating

**Design:** Parent–child coordinate transfer uses exact offset arithmetic (`child_coord = parent_coord - offset`) instead of InterpolationMap. This eliminates floating-point drift that was conceptually wrong and numerically unnecessary.

### Key Evidence

| Test | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| `test_parent_to_child_basic` | `_get_child_coordinate()` returns exact result |
| `test_parent_to_child_out_of_bounds` | Returns None for coordinates outside child span |
| `test_child_to_parent_basic` | `_get_parent_coordinate_from_child()` returns exact result |
| `test_roundtrip_exact` | parent→child→parent produces exact original coordinate |
| `test_recursive_grandchild` | Offset arithmetic works through nested children |
| `test_timestamp_uses_offset` | `TimeStamp.get()` resolves children via offset, not InterpolationMap |
| `test_zero_offset_child` | Edge case: child at offset 0 |
| `test_multiple_children` | Multiple children resolved independently |
| `test_exact_boundary_coordinates` | Boundary values (0, length-epsilon) are handled correctly |

### Design

The `Timeline._get_interpolation_map()` method (part of the `TimeStampSource` protocol) now returns `None` for `Timeline` instances. `TimeStamp.get()` tries offset arithmetic first via duck-typing (`_get_child_coordinate`), falling back to InterpolationMap for `TimelineGroup`.

---

## MatchGraph Tests (`test_graph.py`)

### What We're Validating

The MatchGraph enforces the design principle that only synchronous claims produce graph edges, while non-synchronous claims are stored as metadata. The `extend_to_groups()` method creates `MatchClaim.implicit()` objects with `source_claim_id` traceability, and filtering supports domain/unit/timeline constraints.

### Local Fixtures (no conftest shadowing)

`test_graph.py` defines its own small group-test timelines with dimensions that
differ from the Thoresen fixtures in `conftest.py` (1000 px / 800 px / 100 s vs.
4835 px / 4328 px / 150 s). To avoid silently shadowing the conftest fixtures of
the same name, these local fixtures carry dimension-explicit names:

| Old (shadowed conftest) | New (local, dimension-explicit) | Used by |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|---------|
| `dgt1_timeline` | `dgt1_1000px_timeline` | `dgt1_group` |
| `dgt2_timeline` | `dgt2_800px_timeline` | (defined for symmetry; no current user) |
| `audio_timeline` | `audio_100s_timeline` | `dgt1_group` |

All coordinate assertions in this file are exact `==`: the stamp-coordinate
checks in `test_extend_creates_correct_coordinates` (50.0) and
`test_two_groups_five_implicit_claims` (250.0, 100.0, 200.0) are linear
group conversions at exactly representable ratios and carry no `pytest.approx`.

### Key Test Classes

| Class | Tests | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `TestMatchGraphNonSynchronousClaims` | 4 | Non-synchronous claims stored as metadata, no edges created |
| `TestMatchGraphGetStamps` | 4 | `get_stamps()` returns one stamp per connected component |
| `TestMatchGraphExtendToGroupsImplicitClaims` | 5 | Implicit claims created with correct coordinates and traceability |
| `TestMatchGraphExtendToGroupsFilters` | 4 | `include_timelines`, `exclude_timelines`, `include_domains`, `include_units` |
| `TestMatchGraphFilter` | 3 | `filter()` preserves non-synchronous claims for remaining timelines |
| `TestMatchStampGetGroupCoordinates` | 2 | Fixed `get_group_coordinates()` using `timeline_ids` (was broken) |

### Key Evidence

| Test | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| `test_non_synchronous_claims_stored_as_metadata` | Non-synchronous claims don't create edges; graph has 0 edges |
| `test_synchronous_and_non_synchronous_separation` | `synchronous_claims` and `non_synchronous_claims` properties partition correctly |
| `test_get_stamps_returns_one_per_component` | Connected components yield separate stamps |
| `test_get_stamps_matches_legacy_for_single_claim` | Backward compatibility with `get_match_stamps()` |
| `test_implicit_claims_have_source_id` | Implicit claims trace back to originating explicit claim |
| `test_two_groups_full_connectivity` | Core test: 1 explicit claim between TL1∈{TL1,TL4,TL5} and TL2∈{TL2,TL6} produces 5 connected timelines with correct interpolated coordinates |
| `test_include_timelines_filter` | Only specified timelines appear in extension |
| `test_include_domains_filter` | Only timelines from specified domains appear |
| `test_filter_preserves_relevant_non_synchronous` | `filter()` keeps non-synchronous claims whose timelines survive filtering |
| `test_get_group_coordinates_basic` | Returns coordinates for all group members via `TimelineGroup.convert()` |

### The Two-Groups Connectivity Test

```python
def test_two_groups_full_connectivity(self):
    # Group A = {TL1, TL4, TL5}, Group B = {TL2, TL6}
    # One explicit claim: TL1@100 <-> TL2@200
    # After extend_to_groups():
    #   - TL4, TL5 get coordinates via Group A interpolation from TL1@100
    #   - TL6 gets coordinate via Group B interpolation from TL2@200
    #   - All 5 timelines connected in one component
    stamps = graph.get_stamps()
    assert len(stamps) == 1
    assert len(stamps[0].coordinates) == 5  # All timelines present
```

This is the core group-extension test: it verifies that group extension creates implicit claims with coordinates derived from `TimelineGroup.convert()`, producing a fully connected component from a single explicit claim.

---

## MatchLine Tests (`test_matchline.py`)

### What We're Validating

`MatchLine` is an ordered sequence of `MatchStamp` objects for a given source timeline. It is the bridge between `MatchGraph` and `WarpMap`. A MatchLine collects stamps, sorts them by source coordinate, and exposes `get_coordinate_pairs()` for WarpMap construction.

### Test Classes

| Class | Tests | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `TestMatchLineBasic` | 6 | Construction, sorting, empty/single stamp, filtering of stamps missing source |
| `TestTargetTimelineIds` | 4 | `target_timeline_ids()` returns only timelines with >= 2 stamps |
| `TestGetCoordinatePairs` | 6 | Extraction of `(source_coord, target_coord)` pairs, partial stamps, error on self-target |
| `TestFromClaims` | 5 | `from_claims()` with ordering, interval claims, group extension, non-synchronous exclusion |
| `TestFromGraphs` | 6 | `from_graphs()` merging, deduplication, Hendrix M6-M9 pattern |
| `TestMatchLineSerialization` | 4 | `to_dict()`/`from_dict()` round-trip, `__repr__` |
| `TestMatchLineIntegration` | 2 | Thoresen segment claims end-to-end, group extension coordinate pairs |

### Key Evidence

| Test | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| `test_stamps_sorted_by_source_coordinate` | Stamps are auto-sorted by source coordinate even if provided out of order |
| `test_stamps_without_source_are_dropped` | Stamps missing the source timeline are silently dropped (with log warning) |
| `test_target_timeline_ids_two_or_more` | `target_timeline_ids()` excludes timelines appearing in < 2 stamps (minimum for interpolation) |
| `test_same_as_source_raises` | `get_coordinate_pairs()` raises ValueError when target == source |
| `test_from_claims_with_group_extension` | `from_claims()` with group parameters adds group member coordinates (audio mapped linearly) |
| `test_from_claims_non_synchronous_excluded` | Non-synchronous claims (NOMATCH) do not produce stamps |
| `test_from_graphs_hendrix_pattern` | Four contiguous M-box graphs merged into 5 unique source coordinates (boundary deduplication) |
| `test_from_graphs_keeps_richer_stamp` | Deduplication keeps the stamp with more timelines |
| `test_thoresen_matchline` | Thoresen segment claims produce correct boundary pairs: (0,0) to (4835,4328) |

### The Hendrix Pattern Test

```python
def test_from_graphs_hendrix_pattern(self):
    # 4 contiguous M-boxes, each with 2 boundary claims
    # Boundaries: 0, 100, 200, 300, 400
    # Adjacent M-boxes share boundary coordinates -> deduplicated
    graphs = [MatchGraph([...]) for i in range(4)]
    line = MatchLine.from_graphs(graphs, source_timeline_id="score")
    assert line.n_stamps == 5  # 5 unique coordinates
    assert line.source_coordinates == [0.0, 100.0, 200.0, 300.0, 400.0]
```

This validates the Hendrix M6-M9 use case from the conceptual model: multiple MatchGraphs representing contiguous subsections can be merged into a single ordered MatchLine for WarpMap generation.

---

## AlignmentBundle Tests (`test_bundle.py`)

### What We're Validating

`AlignmentBundle` uses the `MatchLine` → `WarpMap` pipeline. The bundle lazily builds `WarpMap` objects on first cross-group `transfer()` call and caches them, invalidating the cache when `add_match_claims()` is called.

### Key Test Classes

| Class | Tests | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `TestCrossGroupTransfer` | 6 | `transfer()` across groups via WarpMap (direct, boundary, interpolation, reverse, non-existent path) |
| `TestIndirectTransfer` | 2 | Within-group convert then cross-group warp (indirect path) |
| `TestGroupExtension` | 2 | Claims connect score→audio; transfer propagates to midi via group membership |
| `TestGetTimestampAtCrossGroup` | 3 | `get_timestamp_at()` propagation across groups (flat, nested, prefix formats) |
| `TestCommensurabilityWithClaims` | 3 | `are_commensurable()` returns True when claims connect groups (direct + via membership) |
| `TestCacheInvalidation` | 2 | WarpMap cache cleared on `add_match_claims()` |
| `TestEdgeCases` | 6 | No claims, non-synchronous claims, single claim insufficient for WarpMap |
| `TestAddMatchClaimsAPI` | 3 | Chaining, accumulation, no-arg validation |
| `TestAddGroupWithCrossGroupTransfer` | 4 | `add_group()` + cross-group claims + transfer end-to-end |

### Key Evidence

| Test | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| `test_cross_group_transfer_direct` | Score@0.0 → Audio@0.0 via WarpMap (exact boundary) |
| `test_cross_group_transfer_interpolation` | Interior coordinates interpolated correctly |
| `test_cross_group_transfer_reverse` | Bidirectional: Audio→Score as well as Score→Audio |
| `test_indirect_transfer_through_group` | MIDI→Audio via group convert, then Audio→Score via WarpMap |
| `test_group_extension_transfer` | Claims between Score and Audio propagate to MIDI via recording group membership |
| `test_get_timestamp_at_cross_group_flat` | `get_timestamp_at()` returns coordinates for timelines in both groups |
| `test_commensurable_via_claims` | `are_commensurable()` detects cross-group connectivity through claims |
| `test_cache_invalidated_on_add_claims` | New claims clear cached WarpMaps; subsequent transfer uses updated data |
| `test_no_cross_group_claims_returns_none` | `transfer()` returns None when no claims connect the groups |
| `test_non_synchronous_claims_no_transfer` | Non-synchronous claims (NOMATCH) don't produce WarpMaps |

### Design: Lazy WarpMap Cache

```python
# Bundle maintains:
_warp_map_cache: dict[tuple[str, str], WarpMap]  # (source_group, target_group) -> WarpMap
_cache_claims_hash: int  # Invalidation key

# On transfer():
warp = self._get_or_build_warp_map(source_group_id, target_group_id)
result = warp(source_coord)
```

The cache is keyed by `(source_group_id, target_group_id)` and invalidated whenever `add_match_claims()` is called. This avoids redundant `MatchLine.from_claims()` + `WarpMap.from_match_line()` computation for repeated queries.

### `get_matchstamp_table` Conversion Columns

`get_matchstamp_table` accepts a keyword-only `conversion_maps` spec
(default `False`, matching the opt-in default now shared by every
matchstamp getter). When given, `_assemble_matchstamp_table` adds one
derived column per (timeline, enabled unit-conversion map) after the
timeline columns already in the table — **numeric unit conversions only**
(a map's `target_unit` must be set); label/structured maps surface in
`MatchStamp` display but never become table columns. A derived column's
name is the map's target-unit name, qualified `"<timeline_id>:<unit>"`
when two timelines would otherwise produce the same unit name — the same
collision rule `TimeStamp`/`MatchStamp` display uses.

Fixture: a single `clock` timeline (length 100 seconds, `uid="clock"`,
`as_group="clock-group"`) carrying the two exact-value `TableMap`s from
`test_stamp_interface.py` — seconds→milliseconds (`[0,100]->[0,100000]`)
and seconds→frames (`[0,100]->[0,5000]`).

| Test | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| `test_matchstamp_table_adds_conversion_columns` | `get_matchstamp_table(coordinates=[25.0], timeline_id="clock", conversion_maps=True)` returns columns `{"clock", "milliseconds", "frames"}`, one row, with exact values `clock=25.0`, `milliseconds=25000.0`, `frames=1250.0` |
| `test_matchstamp_table_no_conversion_columns_by_default` | Omitting `conversion_maps` yields `column_names == ["clock"]` — no derived columns |
| `test_matchstamp_table_conversion_column_collision_qualified` | Two timelines in different groups, each with its own seconds→milliseconds map, linked by one cross-group synchronous claim: requesting the table with `conversion_maps=True` qualifies both derived columns as `"<timeline_id>:milliseconds"` rather than colliding on a bare `"milliseconds"` |

### Coordinate-Type Parity (raw / Coordinate / IdCoordinate)

Every coordinate-accepting query method must accept a raw `int`/`float`/
`Fraction`, a `Coordinate`, or an `IdCoordinate` and resolve all three to the
same result when their units are native to the receiving timeline. A
unit-qualified coordinate is resolved through that timeline before graph or
group lookup: a C-Map may convert an afforded unit, while an unafforded unit
raises `ValueError`. For methods that pair a coordinate with the id of the
timeline it lives on (`get_matchstamp_at`, `get_timestamp_at`), an
`IdCoordinate` supplies that id, so the `timeline_id` argument becomes
optional; passing a non-Id coordinate without an explicit `timeline_id` is an
error. An explicit ID and an `IdCoordinate` ID must agree, including for the
named source endpoints of `transfer` and `transfer_interval`.

These tests reuse the existing `_make_cross_group_bundle()` +
`_make_linear_claims()` fixtures (no new corpus). The claims map
`score_t → audio_t` linearly (`audio = score * 0.5`), so a query at score 100
resolves to audio 50 — an exact value with no interpolation rounding. Parity is
asserted by comparing the whole result across all three call forms, plus a
pinned concrete value.

A key implementation detail documented in the helper docstring: the MatchGraph
that backs `get_matchstamp_at` is keyed on the timeline ids carried by the
claims (the *actual* timeline ids), whereas `transfer` and `get_timestamp_at`
are keyed on the bundle *UIDs*. The tests pass the right key space to each
method accordingly.

| Test class | Validates |
|------------|-----------|
| `TestGetMatchstampAtCoordinateParity` | raw / native-unit Coordinate / IdCoordinate-alone agree; C-Map conversion agrees with a native query; unavailable units and conflicting IDs ⇒ `ValueError`; non-coordinate type ⇒ `TypeError` |
| `TestGetTimestampAtCoordinateParity` | same three forms produce identical whole-dict results; error paths identical |
| `TestTransferCoordinateParity` | `transfer`/`transfer_interval` resolve native-unit Coordinate/IdCoordinate inputs through the named source timeline; non-coordinate ⇒ `TypeError` |

The same parity is validated for `TimelineGroup.convert()` in
`test_groups.py::TestConvert` (`test_convert_accepts_coordinate_objects`,
`test_convert_rejects_unsupported_type`): `convert(75 seconds → dgt1)` returns
the exact pixel value `2438` for all three coordinate forms.

## WarpMap Tests (`test_warpmap.py`)

### What We're Validating

`WarpMap` is a standalone class that materialises warped timeline copies from alignment data. It wraps an `InterpolationMap` internally for O(log n) coordinate conversion and bridges the gap between `MatchLine` and `AlignmentBundle`.

### Test Classes

| Class | Tests | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `TestWarpMapConstruction` | 5 | Basic init, `from_match_line()`, `from_coordinate_pairs()`, rejection of <2 points |
| `TestForwardInverse` | 5 | Linear mapping, identity, extrapolation, inverse round-trip |
| `TestMaterialise` | 7 | Event warping (instant/interval), child warping, region warping, event count, empty timeline |
| `TestMaterialiseTypeConversion` | 3 | CLT→CPT type conversion, unit propagation, region unit conversion |
| `TestSerialization` | 4 | `to_dict()`/`from_dict()` round-trip, repr |
| `TestMultiTarget` | 1 | Different WarpMaps from same MatchLine for different targets |
| `TestIntegrationWithClaims` | 1 | End-to-end: MatchClaim → AlignmentAnchor → MatchLine → WarpMap |
| `TestEdgeCases` | 10 | Non-linear warping, single-point rejection, degenerate intervals, large datasets, overlapping regions |

### Key Evidence

| Test | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| `test_forward_inverse_roundtrip` | `inverse(forward(x)) ≈ x` for all x in domain |
| `test_materialise_warps_instant_events` | Instant event coordinates warped correctly (reads `start` struct dict, not `instant`) |
| `test_materialise_warps_interval_events` | Start/end/duration all warped; duration uses `forward(start+dur) - forward(start)` for non-linear correctness |
| `test_materialise_warps_children` | Child offsets converted, child count preserved |
| `test_materialise_warps_regions` | Region boundaries converted, region names preserved |
| `test_type_conversion_clt_to_cpt` | Source CLT (quarters) → target CPT (seconds): correct type and unit |
| `test_full_pipeline` | MatchClaim → AlignmentAnchor → MatchLine → WarpMap → forward/inverse |

### EventData Struct Dict Discovery

A key implementation discovery documented in the tests: EventData converts `{"instant": 0.0}` to `{"start": {"value": 0.0, "numerator": None, "denominator": None}}` internally. The `instant` key is NOT preserved — it becomes `start`. The `temporal_type` field distinguishes instant vs interval events. WarpMap's `_warp_events()` handles both the struct dict format and plain floats.

### Floating-Point Tolerance (retained `pytest.approx`)

Every anchor, linear/non-linear forward map, inverse map, extrapolation, chord
dedup, and every materialise assertion (lengths, instants, note
start/end/duration, region boundaries) resolves to an exactly representable
`float` and is asserted with `==`. The two fixed-input round-trip loops
(`test_round_trip_precision`, `test_round_trip_nonlinear`) also now use `==`:
each listed value recovers **bit-exactly** through `forward(inverse(x))` — the
earlier "accumulated sub-epsilon error" rationale was false for these specific
inputs. Only one assertion in this file retains `pytest.approx`, because it is
genuinely floating-point:

| Test | Tolerance | Why approx is required |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| `test_proportional_warp_between_dgt_timelines` | `abs=1e-9` | The interior expected value `967 + (378/867) * 967` uses the non-dyadic rational scale `378/867`, which the map's interpolation and this test's recomputation evaluate via slightly different float operation orders (difference ~2.27e-13). The boundary-anchor loop in the same test maps anchors exactly and uses `==`. |

---

## Graphical Loader Tests (`test_graphical_loader.py`)

### What We're Validating

The graphical loader creates `GraphicalBundle` objects from images, mapping 2D pixel coordinates to 1D timeline coordinates.

### Key Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `TimeAxisPath` | Abstract path mapping 1D -> 2D coordinates |
| `HorizontalLinePath` | Time axis as horizontal line (most common) |
| `ImageSource` | Unified image interface (files, PDFs) |
| `GraphicalSegment` | Source + path + timeline offset |
| `GraphicalBundle` | Complete timeline with coordinate conversion |
| `GraphicalLoader` | Factory for building bundles |

### Test Data

Test images are in `tests/data/thoresen/` (fetched via `pooch`; see `tests/data/README.md`):

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `thoresen_2009_sound-objects_p312_page1_1.jpeg` | DGT1: single image, 5 horizontal systems |
| `thoresen_2010_form-building-patterns_p90-91_page*.jpeg` | DGT2: 5 separate images |

### Coordinate Data (from Applications.ipynb)

**DGT1 (2009):**
- Single image with 5 horizontal systems
- x-boundaries: (2, 969) for all systems = 967 pixels each
- y-positions: [18, 205, 396, 588, 785]
- Total width: 4835 pixels

**DGT2 (2010):**
- 5 separate images with varying dimensions
- Segment bounds (x0, x1, y): [(8,874,15), (7,874,18), (7,874,19), (8,872,15), (9,873,20)]
- Segment lengths: [866, 867, 867, 864, 864]
- Total width: 4328 pixels

**Event H (rect_h2):**
- Segment index: 1 (second segment)
- Local coordinates: [378, 517] (385-7 to 385-7+139)
- Global coordinates: [866+378, 866+517] = [1244, 1383]

### Why These Values Are Exact

The pixel coordinates come from:
1. Manual measurement in image editing software (x0, x1, y for each system)
2. Ground truth TSV files with annotated event locations
3. Cross-validation between Applications.ipynb calculations and test assertions

Any discrepancy between these sources indicates a bug that must be investigated--not tolerated

### Floating-Point Tolerance (retained `pytest.approx`)

Horizontal- and diagonal-path coordinate maps, all `GraphicalSegment`
to_image/from_image conversions, and every `GraphicalBundle`
timeline↔image conversion (including the DGT1/DGT2 event round-trips) land on
exactly representable values and are asserted with `==`. The only retained
`pytest.approx` assertion is the quarter-circle arc-length test, which is
genuinely floating-point:

| Test | Tolerance | Why approx is required |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| `TestParametricPath::test_circle_quarter` | `rel=0.01` | Arc length of a quarter circle is computed by sampling 1000 points and summing chord lengths — a numerical approximation of `r·π/2`. |

The other two `ParametricPath` tests are now asserted with `==`:

- `test_straight_line_as_parametric` — every sampled segment of the
  `y=0` line contributes an exact chord length, so the accumulated arc length
  is exactly `100.0`, not a tolerance-bounded integral.
- `test_to_2d_endpoints` (4 asserts) — `ParametricPath._arc_to_t` does **not**
  search the sampled table at the endpoints: it clamps `arc <= 0` to `t_start`
  and `arc >= total_length` to `t_end` and returns the exact endpoint
  (`paths.py:450-455`). So `to_2d(0)` and `to_2d(length)` are bit-exact
  `(0, 0)` and `(100, 50)`.

## Unified Stamp & Query API Tests

### ClaimFilter Tests (`test_filters.py`)

Tests for the `ClaimFilter` dataclass — the Unified Filter API. Covers all filter parameters individually and in combination:

| Class | Tests | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `TestClaimFilterCreation` | 5 | Empty filter, mutual exclusion, `from_kwargs`, repr |
| `TestClaimFilterExactId` | 4 | `timeline_id` filter on A-side, B-side, mismatch, timeline-level |

| `TestClaimFilterCombined` | 4 | AND logic across multiple filters |

### Stamp & Query API Tests (`test_stamp_query_api.py`)

Tests for the Unified Stamp & Query API, using a star-topology bundle (1 score + 3 performers, 5 coordinates each, plus 1 NOMATCH claim).

| Class | Tests | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `TestGetMatchClaims` | 8 | `AlignmentBundle.get_match_claims()`: no filters, by timeline ID, by regex, synchronous_only, nomatch_only, between, combined |
| `TestMatchGraphGetMatchstamp` | 4 | `MatchGraph.get_matchstamp()`: single component, multi-component raises, empty graph, only-NOMATCH |
| `TestMatchGraphSplitComponents` | 4 | `split_components()`: single, two components, empty graph, `n_components` property |
| `TestMatchGraphStarTopology` | 2 | Star topology (1 score + N performers): single coordinate = one component, determinism |
| `TestMatchClaimGetMatchstamp` | 4 | `MatchClaim.get_matchstamp()`: reduced stamp, NOMATCH returns None, no-bundle raises, from-graph with bundle |
| `TestMatchGraphCache` | 5 | MatchGraph cache: hit, cross-key lookup, invalidation, no-claims raises, different coordinates |

| `TestMatchClaimDisplay` | 9 | `MatchClaim.__str__`/`_repr_html_`: instant, interval, NOMATCH, metadata, inferred, valid HTML, NOMATCH badge, affordance `Try` footer (`claim.get_matchstamp()`) appended after the table |
| `TestTransferDocstring` | 1 | `transfer()` docstring no longer says "primary user-facing" |
| `TestTopLevelExports` | 4 | `MatchGraph`, `MatchStamp`, `ClaimFilter` importable from top-level |

### TimelineIdGenerator Tests (`../core/test_ids.py`)

Tests for the `TimelineIdGenerator` class that generates systematic timeline IDs based on type. 12 tests covering:

| Area | Tests | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Basic generation | 3 | Counter increments, prefix mapping for all 6 timeline types |
| Role-based IDs | 2 | `next_id_with_role()` produces `role:prefix{N}` format |
| Metadata | 2 | Metadata association and retrieval |
| Reset/isolation | 3 | Counter reset, independent instances |
| Edge cases | 2 | Unknown types, large counter values |

### Deprecated Tests

The following test methods use the deprecated `PerfectAlignment` class and will be removed in a future version:

- `TestBackwardCompatibility.test_from_reference_still_works`
- `TestBackwardCompatibility.test_iter_timelines_still_works`

These tests verify backward compatibility during the migration period.
